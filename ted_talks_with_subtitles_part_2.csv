Political scientist Ian Bremmer argues it's not as simple as it used to be. With some eye-opening questions about the nature of leadership, he asks us to consider the impact of the evolving global order and our choices as participants in the future of democracy.","global issues, politics, technology, economics, social change, government, international relations",2023,"I have a big question. Which is, who runs the world? It used to be an easy question to answer. If you're over 45 like me, you grew up in a world that was dominated by two giants. The United States called the shots on one side of the Wall, the Soviets set the rules on the other. And that was a bipolar world. It's very simple. If you're under 45, you grew up when the Soviet Union had already collapsed, and that left the United States as the sole superpower, dominating global institutions and also exerting raw power. And that was a unipolar world. And then about 15 years ago, things got a little more complicated. The United States increasingly didn't want to be the world's policeman or the architect of global trade or even the cheerleader for global values. Other countries were becoming more powerful, and they could increasingly ignore many of the rules they didn't like, sometimes even setting new rules themselves. What happened? Three things. Number one, Russia was not integrated into Western institutions. A former great power now in very serious decline and they are angry about it. We can argue about whose fault that is, but we are where we are. Number two, China was integrated into US-led institutions on the presumption that as they got wealthier and more powerful, they would become Americans. Turns out, they're still Chinese. (Laughter) And the United States is not particularly comfortable with that. Number three, tens of millions of citizens in the United States and other wealthy democracies felt left behind by globalization. This has been ignored for decades. But as a consequence, they felt that their governments and their leaders were more illegitimate. Now if you look at all the headlines in the world today, driving all of this geopolitical tension and conflict, over 90 percent of them are because of these three reasons. And that's why today we live in a leaderless world. But as we know, that's not going to be with us for long. So what comes next? What kind of a world order might we expect over the next ten years? Some of what I might say I think will surprise you. Because we're not going to have a bipolar or a unipolar or even a multipolar world. If we don't have one or two superpowers, we don't have a single global order. No, instead, we will have three different orders, a little overlapping, and the third will have immense importance for how we live, what we think, what we want, and what we're prepared to do to get it. But first things first. Today, we have a global security order. And as you see from the map, the United States and its allies are the most powerful players on it. The US is the only country in the world that can send its soldiers and its sailors and its military equipment to every corner of that world. No one else is close. China is growing in its military capabilities in Asia, though nowhere else. Lots of American allies in Asia are concerned about that. And as a consequence, they're becoming more dependent on the United States for a security umbrella. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US allies in Europe are becoming more concerned and dependent on the United States and a US-led NATO. The Russian military, of course, has been a greater global concern, much less so today, especially as they've lost over 200,000 troops and all of that equipment and with sanctions making it extremely hard for them to rebuild. Now, Russia and China and others have nuclear weapons, but thank God it is still suicide to use them. And as a consequence, our security order is a unipolar order and it is likely to remain so for the next decade. Now at the same time that there's a security order, there's also a global economic order. And here, power is shared. The United States is still a very robust global economy. But the US can't use its dominant position militarily to tell other countries what to do economically. The United States and China are enormously economically interdependent and so they can't control each other. You may be surprised to hear this, but today US-China trade relations are actually at their highest level in history. Now, other countries in the world, a lot of them want access to US military muscle, but they also want access to the Chinese market, soon, by 2030, likely to be the largest in the world. And you can't very well have a cold war if the US and the Chinese are the only two that are prepared to fight it. Yes? Yes. So the European Union has the largest common market and they set the rules. And if you want to do profitable business there, you listen to those rules. India is playing a greater role economically on the global stage. Japan still matters, too. And over the next ten years, there will be a rise and fall of the relative capacities of these economies. But the global economic order is and will remain a multipolar order. Now, between these two orders are tensions because the United States will use its power in national security to try to bring more of the world's economies towards it. And we already see this starting to happen in semiconductors and in critical minerals and maybe soon in TikTok. The Chinese are trying to use their dominant commercial position to align more of the world diplomatically. And Japan and Europe and India and everyone else will do their damnedest to ensure that neither of these two orders dominate the other. And they will mostly succeed. Now, so far I have spoken with you about the two world orders we already see, but there's a third that is coming soon that's even more important. And that is the digital order. And the digital order is not run by governments but by technology companies. We all know how much military support NATO countries have provided Ukraine during the war. But it's technology companies that provided the tools allowing Ukraine to defend itself from Russian cyber attack. It's technology companies that gave the Ukrainian leaders the ability to speak with their generals and their soldiers on the front lines. If it wasn't for those technology companies, Ukraine would have been fully offline within weeks of the war. And I don't believe President Zelensky would still be there today. Technology companies determine whether Donald Trump is able, in real time and without filter, to speak with hundreds of millions of people as he runs again for the presidency. It's social media platforms and their ability to promote disinformation and conspiracy theory. Without them, we do not have riots in the Capitol on January 6. We do not have trucker riots in Ottawa. We do not have a January 8 insurrection in Brazil. Technology companies increasingly determine our identities. When I was growing up, it's nature or nurture. I mean, my deep and abiding emotional problems either come from how I was raised -- (Laughter) Or some genetic failure. (Laughter) Could be both. (Laughter) But today, our identities are determined by nature and nurture and algorithm. If you want to challenge the system, you can't just question authority, as we were all told when we were growing up. Today, you have to question the algorithm, and that is a staggering amount of power in the hands of these technology companies. What are they going to do with that power? And that depends on who they want to be when they grow up. So if China and the United States work to exert much more power over the digital world and technology companies in those countries align with those governments, we will end up in a technology cold war. And that means the digital order will be split in two. If, on the other hand technology companies persist with global business models, and we retain competition between the digital and physical worlds, we will have a new globalization, a digital global order. Or if the digital order becomes increasingly dominant and governments erode in their capacity to govern, and we've already seen the beginning of this, technology companies will become the dominant actors on the global stage in every way and we will have a techno-polar order. And that will determine whether we have a world of limitless opportunity or a world without freedom. Now at this point in my speech, I'm supposed to talk about the good news. (Laughter) But those of you that have heard this know that that is not coming. (Laughter) There is no pause button on these explosive and disruptive technologies. I don't know if you know this, there are over 100 people in the world today with the knowledge and the technology to create a new smallpox virus. Honestly, I don't have answers, but I have a few questions for the people that do. Because these technology companies are not just Fortune 50 and 100 actors. These technology titans are not just men worth 50 or 100 billion dollars or more. They are increasingly the most powerful people on the planet with influence over our futures. And we need to know, are they going to act accountably as they release new and powerful artificial intelligence? What are they going to do with this unprecedented amount of data that they are collecting on us and our environment? And the one that I think should concern us all right now the most: Will they persist with these advertising models driving so much revenues that are turning citizens into products and driving hate and misinformation and ripping apart our society? (Applause) When I was a student back in 1989, and the Wall fell, the United States was the principal exporter of democracy in the world. Not always successfully. Often hypocritically. But number one, nonetheless. Today, the United States has become the principal exporter of tools that destroy democracy. The technology leaders who create and control these tools, are they OK with that? Or are they going to do something about it? We need to know. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

He explains how Duolingo harnesses the psychological techniques of social media and mobile games to get you excited to learn — all while spreading access to education across the world.","technology, business, computers, education, communication, language, motivation, personal growth, AI, teaching, kids",2023,"So, I'm from Guatemala. This is a public service announcement, that is where Guatemala is. (Laughter) Also, that is not where they keep the prisoners. That is called Guantanamo. (Laughter) Not the same place. So Guatemala's right below Mexico. And for the Americans in the audience, and let this sink in, because it really applies in most ways, for the Americans in the audience, you can think of it as Mexico's Mexico. (Laughter) Just like the US doesn't want illegal immigration from Mexico, Mexico doesn't want illegal immigration from Guatemala. It's a smaller country. It's a poor country. And well, what can I tell you, it has much better Mexican food. (Laughter) Guatemala is a very poor country. And a lot of people talk about education as something that brings equality to different social classes. But I always saw it as the opposite, as something that brings inequality. Because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money can buy themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money. Whereas people who don't have very much money barely learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money. And this is especially true in poor countries. Now, I was fortunate that I received a rich person's education even though I didn't grow up rich. And it’s because I’m an only child. And my mother, who was a single mother, spent all of her resources on my education. And this allowed me to come to college to the US and eventually get a PhD in computer science. Now because of all of this about 10 years ago, I decided I wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone. Oh, by the way, this is what I want to talk to you about today, giving equal access to education to everyone. At the time, I was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I decided to work on this with my PhD student, Severin. The way my brain works, all of education is just too general of a problem. So I decided, let's start by teaching one thing. And then I started thinking, OK, well, what should we teach first? Should we teach math? I mean, we both love math. Me and my cofounder, we both love math. And, you know, we didn't decide to do math. Then we started thinking, well, maybe we should teach computer science. But eventually, and this is maybe surprising to people in North America, eventually, we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages. And let me tell you why. There's a number of reasons. One of them is that there's a huge audience for it. There’s about two billion people in the world learning a foreign language, both in school and outside of schools. Most of these people, by the way, are learning English. About 80 percent of them are learning English. In this weird map right here, all the countries in green are countries in which people are predominantly learning English. And the reason for that is because English can truly transform your life. In most countries in the world, knowledge of English can significantly increase your income potential. So this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages. And it's because you can directly make more money if you learn another language, in particular English. And see, this is pretty different than many other subjects. For example, take math. In the case of math, just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to then become a civil engineer, that's how you make more money. Whereas with languages, if you are a waiter and you learn English, now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money. So we decided, well, let's get started by teaching languages. Now, we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people was by using a mobile phone, or a smartphone in particular. See, building schools all over the world is simply too expensive. On the other hand, most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone, and the trend is that that fraction is only going to increase. So we decided at the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone. And then we called it Duolingo. Thank you. (Applause) Now in order to truly be accessible to everyone, rich and poor, Duolingo uses a freemium model to support itself. What that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay. But if you don't pay, you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson. Now, if you don't like ads, you can also pay to subscribe to turn off the ads. And it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for Duolingo comes from people who pay to subscribe to turn off the ads. Now, who are these people who pay to subscribe to turn off the ads? Well, they're usually well-off people in rich countries like the US and Canada. Who are the people who don't pay to subscribe? They usually come from poorer countries like Brazil or Vietnam or Guatemala. So what I like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically getting the rich people to pay for the education of everyone. So I like that. (Applause) So with smartphones, we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing, which is great. However, if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone, you run into a humongous problem. And it is that smartphones come equipped with some of the most addictive drugs that humanity has ever engineered. TikTok, Instagram, mobile games. See, delivering education over a smartphone is like hoping that people will eat their broccoli, but right next to it, you put the most delicious dessert ever made. (Laughter) If you really want to deliver education to everyone, not only do you have to make it accessible, but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn. And with Duolingo, we've been able to do this. And at the highest level, the way we've done this is by making the broccoli taste like dessert. I'll say it another way. What we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that apps like Instagram, TikTok or mobile games use to keep people engaged, but in this case, we use them to keep people engaged but with education. Let me give you some examples of these techniques. One of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak. What a streak is, is it’s just a counter that measures the number of days that you've used the product consecutively. You just take that number, you put it very prominently in your product and then people come back every day. And the reason people come back every day is because, well, if they don't come back, that number resets to zero and people don't want to lose their streak. It works. Now, on the one side, streaks have been criticized for, for example, getting teens addicted to Snapchat. But in the case of an educational app, streaks get people to come back to study every day. Now, to give you an idea of the power of streaks, in the case of Duolingo, we have over three million daily active users that have a streak longer than 365. (Applause) That means they haven't missed a day in the last year or longer. Now, fun fact about streaks. What country do you think has the longest average streaks for an educational app? It's Japan. Of course. Shortest-ever streaks? Latin America, baby. (Laughter) But we're fun, hey, we're fun. (Laughter) Another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product are notifications. On the one side, notifications can be really spammy and annoying, but in the case of an educational product, people actually want to be reminded to learn. In the case of Duolingo, we have a very sophisticated AI system that basically chooses when to send the notification and also what to say in each notification to maximize the probability that people come back. Now, interestingly, even after all this sophistication, it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what time to send you a notification is pretty simple. Do you know what is the best time to send people a notification? I'll tell you. It's 24 hours after they used the product last. There's an easy explanation. If you were free yesterday at 3pm, you’re probably free today at 3pm as well. So this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of AI found. (Laughter) It's funny. Now with notifications you shouldn't be spamming. And we're not spamming, with Duolingo, we actually stop sending notifications after seven days of inactivity. So if you don't use Duolingo for seven days, we stop sending you notifications. Now, at some point it occurred to us, if we're stopping to send people notifications, we should let them know. So we started sending this notification to people saying, ""Hey, these reminders don't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now."" You know what people do when they get this notification? They come back. (Laughter) Passive aggressive. (Laughter) Works for my mother, works for Duolingo. (Laughter and applause) These passive aggressive notifications are really good at getting people to come back back because they feel like our green owl mascot has given up on them, so they come back. And speaking of our green owl mascot, by the way, because all our notifications come from our green owl mascot and well, he's passive aggressive and also pretty pushy, this has given rise to a lot of memes on the internet that make fun of the great lengths that he will go through to get you back to learn a language. Here's one of my favorite ones. This is it's a meme, it’s one of my favorite ones. (Laughter) Basically looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons. And then there's an intruder alert, presumably the owl broke into your house to get you to learn language. Now, Duolingo has entered the zeitgeist. And there's thousands of memes, there's SNL skits about it. And it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that mobile games and social media use to get people engaged. And this is a really important point, let me say this. I don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app be as engaging as something like TikTok or Instagram or mobile games. But the good news is that -- And by the way, the reason I don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something. And it's hard to compete with, like, cats and celebrities. But the good news is that I don't think you have to. See, here's the thing. When you're learning something, you get meaning out of it. Whereas when you're scrolling for two hours on Instagram, a lot of times afterwards, you feel like you just wasted your time. So I think it's actually OK if your educational product is only 80 or 90 percent as engaging as something like TikTok, because the other 10 or 20 percent will be provided by people's internal motivation, though of course, not much more than that. This is really a key point. If we want to get people to do something meaningful, you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it. And even if you're not as engaging as those apps are, you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product. In the case of Duolingo, for example, there are more people learning languages on Duolingo in the United States than there are people learning languages across all US high schools combined. (Applause) And this is true in most countries in the world. My hope is that -- I know we can do this, but, you know, my hope is that as humanity, we can do what Duolingo has done for learning languages but for all other subjects. Where we can get people to learn math with mobile phones, like millions of people to learn math with mobile phones or physics or whatever. I hope for a future in which screen time is not a bad thing, in which we can deliver high-quality education to everyone, rich or poor, using a mobile phone. But the single most important thing that I can end this talk with, is a reminder to please, pretty please, I beg you, do your language lessons today. Thank you very much. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Luis, thank you so much. I wonder if you can just say a little bit more about that last point, how do you think you can apply this type of thinking to other subjects? So you mentioned math, and things like that. How do you do that? Luis von Ahn: I think in particular, subjects that are learned through repetition and it turns out most things that are kind of really meaningful are learned through thousands of repetitions. You learn to read through repetition, you learn elementary school math through repetition. Most things that you can learn through repetition, you can actually gamify and turn into something like Duolingo, where people just do it a lot and do it fun. It's a little harder for things like explanations. That probably is going to require some really good videos. Sal Khan is doing a really good job with that. But for things that require a lot of repetition, I think we can use the same methods. (Applause)"

After the talk, head of TED Chris Anderson joins Brockman to dig into the timeline of ChatGPT's development and get Brockman's take on the risks, raised by many in the tech industry and beyond, of releasing such a powerful tool into the world.","technology, computers, innovation, creativity, future, language, AI, machine learning",2023,"We started OpenAI seven years ago because we felt like something really interesting was happening in AI and we wanted to help steer it in a positive direction. It's honestly just really amazing to see how far this whole field has come since then. And it's really gratifying to hear from people like Raymond who are using the technology we are building, and others, for so many wonderful things. We hear from people who are excited, we hear from people who are concerned, we hear from people who feel both those emotions at once. And honestly, that's how we feel. Above all, it feels like we're entering an historic period right now where we as a world are going to define a technology that will be so important for our society going forward. And I believe that we can manage this for good. So today, I want to show you the current state of that technology and some of the underlying design principles that we hold dear. So the first thing I'm going to show you is what it's like to build a tool for an AI rather than building it for a human. So we have a new DALL-E model, which generates images, and we are exposing it as an app for ChatGPT to use on your behalf. And you can do things like ask, you know, suggest a nice post-TED meal and draw a picture of it. (Laughter) Now you get all of the, sort of, ideation and creative back-and-forth and taking care of the details for you that you get out of ChatGPT. And here we go, it's not just the idea for the meal, but a very, very detailed spread. So let's see what we're going to get. But ChatGPT doesn't just generate images in this case -- sorry, it doesn't generate text, it also generates an image. And that is something that really expands the power of what it can do on your behalf in terms of carrying out your intent. And I'll point out, this is all a live demo. This is all generated by the AI as we speak. So I actually don't even know what we're going to see. This looks wonderful. (Applause) I'm getting hungry just looking at it. Now we've extended ChatGPT with other tools too, for example, memory. You can say ""save this for later."" And the interesting thing about these tools is they're very inspectable. So you get this little pop up here that says ""use the DALL-E app."" And by the way, this is coming to you, all ChatGPT users, over upcoming months. And you can look under the hood and see that what it actually did was write a prompt just like a human could. And so you sort of have this ability to inspect how the machine is using these tools, which allows us to provide feedback to them. Now it's saved for later, and let me show you what it's like to use that information and to integrate with other applications too. You can say, “Now make a shopping list for the tasty thing I was suggesting earlier.” And make it a little tricky for the AI. ""And tweet it out for all the TED viewers out there."" (Laughter) So if you do make this wonderful, wonderful meal, I definitely want to know how it tastes. But you can see that ChatGPT is selecting all these different tools without me having to tell it explicitly which ones to use in any situation. And this, I think, shows a new way of thinking about the user interface. Like, we are so used to thinking of, well, we have these apps, we click between them, we copy/paste between them, and usually it's a great experience within an app as long as you kind of know the menus and know all the options. Yes, I would like you to. Yes, please. Always good to be polite. (Laughter) And by having this unified language interface on top of tools, the AI is able to sort of take away all those details from you. So you don't have to be the one who spells out every single sort of little piece of what's supposed to happen. And as I said, this is a live demo, so sometimes the unexpected will happen to us. But let's take a look at the Instacart shopping list while we're at it. And you can see we sent a list of ingredients to Instacart. Here's everything you need. And the thing that's really interesting is that the traditional UI is still very valuable, right? If you look at this, you still can click through it and sort of modify the actual quantities. And that's something that I think shows that they're not going away, traditional UIs. It's just we have a new, augmented way to build them. And now we have a tweet that's been drafted for our review, which is also a very important thing. We can click “run,” and there we are, we’re the manager, we’re able to inspect, we're able to change the work of the AI if we want to. And so after this talk, you will be able to access this yourself. And there we go. Cool. Thank you, everyone. (Applause) So we’ll cut back to the slides. Now, the important thing about how we build this, it's not just about building these tools. It's about teaching the AI how to use them. Like, what do we even want it to do when we ask these very high-level questions? And to do this, we use an old idea. If you go back to Alan Turing's 1950 paper on the Turing test, he says, you'll never program an answer to this. Instead, you can learn it. You could build a machine, like a human child, and then teach it through feedback. Have a human teacher who provides rewards and punishments as it tries things out and does things that are either good or bad. And this is exactly how we train ChatGPT. It's a two-step process. First, we produce what Turing would have called a child machine through an unsupervised learning process. We just show it the whole world, the whole internet and say, “Predict what comes next in text you’ve never seen before.” And this process imbues it with all sorts of wonderful skills. For example, if you're shown a math problem, the only way to actually complete that math problem, to say what comes next, that green nine up there, is to actually solve the math problem. But we actually have to do a second step, too, which is to teach the AI what to do with those skills. And for this, we provide feedback. We have the AI try out multiple things, give us multiple suggestions, and then a human rates them, says “This one’s better than that one.” And this reinforces not just the specific thing that the AI said, but very importantly, the whole process that the AI used to produce that answer. And this allows it to generalize. It allows it to teach, to sort of infer your intent and apply it in scenarios that it hasn't seen before, that it hasn't received feedback. Now, sometimes the things we have to teach the AI are not what you'd expect. For example, when we first showed GPT-4 to Khan Academy, they said, ""Wow, this is so great, We're going to be able to teach students wonderful things. Only one problem, it doesn't double-check students' math. If there's some bad math in there, it will happily pretend that one plus one equals three and run with it."" So we had to collect some feedback data. Sal Khan himself was very kind and offered 20 hours of his own time to provide feedback to the machine alongside our team. And over the course of a couple of months we were able to teach the AI that, ""Hey, you really should push back on humans in this specific kind of scenario."" And we've actually made lots and lots of improvements to the models this way. And when you push that thumbs down in ChatGPT, that actually is kind of like sending up a bat signal to our team to say, “Here’s an area of weakness where you should gather feedback.” And so when you do that, that's one way that we really listen to our users and make sure we're building something that's more useful for everyone. Now, providing high-quality feedback is a hard thing. If you think about asking a kid to clean their room, if all you're doing is inspecting the floor, you don't know if you're just teaching them to stuff all the toys in the closet. This is a nice DALL-E-generated image, by the way. And the same sort of reasoning applies to AI. As we move to harder tasks, we will have to scale our ability to provide high-quality feedback. But for this, the AI itself is happy to help. It's happy to help us provide even better feedback and to scale our ability to supervise the machine as time goes on. And let me show you what I mean. For example, you can ask GPT-4 a question like this, of how much time passed between these two foundational blogs on unsupervised learning and learning from human feedback. And the model says two months passed. But is it true? Like, these models are not 100-percent reliable, although they’re getting better every time we provide some feedback. But we can actually use the AI to fact-check. And it can actually check its own work. You can say, fact-check this for me. Now, in this case, I've actually given the AI a new tool. This one is a browsing tool where the model can issue search queries and click into web pages. And it actually writes out its whole chain of thought as it does it. It says, I’m just going to search for this and it actually does the search. It then it finds the publication date and the search results. It then is issuing another search query. It's going to click into the blog post. And all of this you could do, but it’s a very tedious task. It's not a thing that humans really want to do. It's much more fun to be in the driver's seat, to be in this manager's position where you can, if you want, triple-check the work. And out come citations so you can actually go and very easily verify any piece of this whole chain of reasoning. And it actually turns out two months was wrong. Two months and one week, that was correct. (Applause) And we'll cut back to the side. And so thing that's so interesting to me about this whole process is that it’s this many-step collaboration between a human and an AI. Because a human, using this fact-checking tool is doing it in order to produce data for another AI to become more useful to a human. And I think this really shows the shape of something that we should expect to be much more common in the future, where we have humans and machines kind of very carefully and delicately designed in how they fit into a problem and how we want to solve that problem. We make sure that the humans are providing the management, the oversight, the feedback, and the machines are operating in a way that's inspectable and trustworthy. And together we're able to actually create even more trustworthy machines. And I think that over time, if we get this process right, we will be able to solve impossible problems. And to give you a sense of just how impossible I'm talking, I think we're going to be able to rethink almost every aspect of how we interact with computers. For example, think about spreadsheets. They've been around in some form since, we'll say, 40 years ago with VisiCalc. I don't think they've really changed that much in that time. And here is a specific spreadsheet of all the AI papers on the arXiv for the past 30 years. There's about 167,000 of them. And you can see there the data right here. But let me show you the ChatGPT take on how to analyze a data set like this. So we can give ChatGPT access to yet another tool, this one a Python interpreter, so it’s able to run code, just like a data scientist would. And so you can just literally upload a file and ask questions about it. And very helpfully, you know, it knows the name of the file and it's like, ""Oh, this is CSV,"" comma-separated value file, ""I'll parse it for you."" The only information here is the name of the file, the column names like you saw and then the actual data. And from that it's able to infer what these columns actually mean. Like, that semantic information wasn't in there. It has to sort of, put together its world knowledge of knowing that, “Oh yeah, arXiv is a site that people submit papers and therefore that's what these things are and that these are integer values and so therefore it's a number of authors in the paper,"" like all of that, that’s work for a human to do, and the AI is happy to help with it. Now I don't even know what I want to ask. So fortunately, you can ask the machine, ""Can you make some exploratory graphs?"" And once again, this is a super high-level instruction with lots of intent behind it. But I don't even know what I want. And the AI kind of has to infer what I might be interested in. And so it comes up with some good ideas, I think. So a histogram of the number of authors per paper, time series of papers per year, word cloud of the paper titles. All of that, I think, will be pretty interesting to see. And the great thing is, it can actually do it. Here we go, a nice bell curve. You see that three is kind of the most common. It's going to then make this nice plot of the papers per year. Something crazy is happening in 2023, though. Looks like we were on an exponential and it dropped off the cliff. What could be going on there? By the way, all this is Python code, you can inspect. And then we'll see word cloud. So you can see all these wonderful things that appear in these titles. But I'm pretty unhappy about this 2023 thing. It makes this year look really bad. Of course, the problem is that the year is not over. So I'm going to push back on the machine. [Waitttt that's not fair!!! 2023 isn't over. What percentage of papers in 2022 were even posted by April 13?] So April 13 was the cut-off date I believe. Can you use that to make a fair projection? So we'll see, this is the kind of ambitious one. (Laughter) So you know, again, I feel like there was more I wanted out of the machine here. I really wanted it to notice this thing, maybe it's a little bit of an overreach for it to have sort of, inferred magically that this is what I wanted. But I inject my intent, I provide this additional piece of, you know, guidance. And under the hood, the AI is just writing code again, so if you want to inspect what it's doing, it's very possible. And now, it does the correct projection. (Applause) If you noticed, it even updates the title. I didn't ask for that, but it know what I want. Now we'll cut back to the slide again. This slide shows a parable of how I think we ... A vision of how we may end up using this technology in the future. A person brought his very sick dog to the vet, and the veterinarian made a bad call to say, “Let’s just wait and see.” And the dog would not be here today had he listened. In the meanwhile, he provided the blood test, like, the full medical records, to GPT-4, which said, ""I am not a vet, you need to talk to a professional, here are some hypotheses."" He brought that information to a second vet who used it to save the dog's life. Now, these systems, they're not perfect. You cannot overly rely on them. But this story, I think, shows that a human with a medical professional and with ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner was able to achieve an outcome that would not have happened otherwise. I think this is something we should all reflect on, think about as we consider how to integrate these systems into our world. And one thing I believe really deeply, is that getting AI right is going to require participation from everyone. And that's for deciding how we want it to slot in, that's for setting the rules of the road, for what an AI will and won't do. And if there's one thing to take away from this talk, it's that this technology just looks different. Just different from anything people had anticipated. And so we all have to become literate. And that's, honestly, one of the reasons we released ChatGPT. Together, I believe that we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson: Greg. Wow. I mean ... I suspect that within every mind out here there's a feeling of reeling. Like, I suspect that a very large number of people viewing this, you look at that and you think, “Oh my goodness, pretty much every single thing about the way I work, I need to rethink."" Like, there's just new possibilities there. Am I right? Who thinks that they're having to rethink the way that we do things? Yeah, I mean, it's amazing, but it's also really scary. So let's talk, Greg, let's talk. I mean, I guess my first question actually is just how the hell have you done this? (Laughter) OpenAI has a few hundred employees. Google has thousands of employees working on artificial intelligence. Why is it you who's come up with this technology that shocked the world? Greg Brockman: I mean, the truth is, we're all building on shoulders of giants, right, there's no question. If you look at the compute progress, the algorithmic progress, the data progress, all of those are really industry-wide. But I think within OpenAI, we made a lot of very deliberate choices from the early days. And the first one was just to confront reality as it lays. And that we just thought really hard about like: What is it going to take to make progress here? We tried a lot of things that didn't work, so you only see the things that did. And I think that the most important thing has been to get teams of people who are very different from each other to work together harmoniously. CA: Can we have the water, by the way, just brought here? I think we're going to need it, it's a dry-mouth topic. But isn't there something also just about the fact that you saw something in these language models that meant that if you continue to invest in them and grow them, that something at some point might emerge? GB: Yes. And I think that, I mean, honestly, I think the story there is pretty illustrative, right? I think that high level, deep learning, like we always knew that was what we wanted to be, was a deep learning lab, and exactly how to do it? I think that in the early days, we didn't know. We tried a lot of things, and one person was working on training a model to predict the next character in Amazon reviews, and he got a result where -- this is a syntactic process, you expect, you know, the model will predict where the commas go, where the nouns and verbs are. But he actually got a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis classifier out of it. This model could tell you if a review was positive or negative. I mean, today we are just like, come on, anyone can do that. But this was the first time that you saw this emergence, this sort of semantics that emerged from this underlying syntactic process. And there we knew, you've got to scale this thing, you've got to see where it goes. CA: So I think this helps explain the riddle that baffles everyone looking at this, because these things are described as prediction machines. And yet, what we're seeing out of them feels ... it just feels impossible that that could come from a prediction machine. Just the stuff you showed us just now. And the key idea of emergence is that when you get more of a thing, suddenly different things emerge. It happens all the time, ant colonies, single ants run around, when you bring enough of them together, you get these ant colonies that show completely emergent, different behavior. Or a city where a few houses together, it's just houses together. But as you grow the number of houses, things emerge, like suburbs and cultural centers and traffic jams. Give me one moment for you when you saw just something pop that just blew your mind that you just did not see coming. GB: Yeah, well, so you can try this in ChatGPT, if you add 40-digit numbers -- CA: 40-digit? GB: 40-digit numbers, the model will do it, which means it's really learned an internal circuit for how to do it. And the really interesting thing is actually, if you have it add like a 40-digit number plus a 35-digit number, it'll often get it wrong. And so you can see that it's really learning the process, but it hasn't fully generalized, right? It's like you can't memorize the 40-digit addition table, that's more atoms than there are in the universe. So it had to have learned something general, but that it hasn't really fully yet learned that, Oh, I can sort of generalize this to adding arbitrary numbers of arbitrary lengths. CA: So what's happened here is that you've allowed it to scale up and look at an incredible number of pieces of text. And it is learning things that you didn't know that it was going to be capable of learning. GB Well, yeah, and it’s more nuanced, too. So one science that we’re starting to really get good at is predicting some of these emergent capabilities. And to do that actually, one of the things I think is very undersung in this field is sort of engineering quality. Like, we had to rebuild our entire stack. When you think about building a rocket, every tolerance has to be incredibly tiny. Same is true in machine learning. You have to get every single piece of the stack engineered properly, and then you can start doing these predictions. There are all these incredibly smooth scaling curves. They tell you something deeply fundamental about intelligence. If you look at our GPT-4 blog post, you can see all of these curves in there. And now we're starting to be able to predict. So we were able to predict, for example, the performance on coding problems. We basically look at some models that are 10,000 times or 1,000 times smaller. And so there's something about this that is actually smooth scaling, even though it's still early days. CA: So here is, one of the big fears then, that arises from this. If it’s fundamental to what’s happening here, that as you scale up, things emerge that you can maybe predict in some level of confidence, but it's capable of surprising you. Why isn't there just a huge risk of something truly terrible emerging? GB: Well, I think all of these are questions of degree and scale and timing. And I think one thing people miss, too, is sort of the integration with the world is also this incredibly emergent, sort of, very powerful thing too. And so that's one of the reasons that we think it's so important to deploy incrementally. And so I think that what we kind of see right now, if you look at this talk, a lot of what I focus on is providing really high-quality feedback. Today, the tasks that we do, you can inspect them, right? It's very easy to look at that math problem and be like, no, no, no, machine, seven was the correct answer. But even summarizing a book, like, that's a hard thing to supervise. Like, how do you know if this book summary is any good? You have to read the whole book. No one wants to do that. (Laughter) And so I think that the important thing will be that we take this step by step. And that we say, OK, as we move on to book summaries, we have to supervise this task properly. We have to build up a track record with these machines that they're able to actually carry out our intent. And I think we're going to have to produce even better, more efficient, more reliable ways of scaling this, sort of like making the machine be aligned with you. CA: So we're going to hear later in this session, there are critics who say that, you know, there's no real understanding inside, the system is going to always -- we're never going to know that it's not generating errors, that it doesn't have common sense and so forth. Is it your belief, Greg, that it is true at any one moment, but that the expansion of the scale and the human feedback that you talked about is basically going to take it on that journey of actually getting to things like truth and wisdom and so forth, with a high degree of confidence. Can you be sure of that? GB: Yeah, well, I think that the OpenAI, I mean, the short answer is yes, I believe that is where we're headed. And I think that the OpenAI approach here has always been just like, let reality hit you in the face, right? It's like this field is the field of broken promises, of all these experts saying X is going to happen, Y is how it works. People have been saying neural nets aren't going to work for 70 years. They haven't been right yet. They might be right maybe 70 years plus one or something like that is what you need. But I think that our approach has always been, you've got to push to the limits of this technology to really see it in action, because that tells you then, oh, here's how we can move on to a new paradigm. And we just haven't exhausted the fruit here. CA: I mean, it's quite a controversial stance you've taken, that the right way to do this is to put it out there in public and then harness all this, you know, instead of just your team giving feedback, the world is now giving feedback. But ... If, you know, bad things are going to emerge, it is out there. So, you know, the original story that I heard on OpenAI when you were founded as a nonprofit, well you were there as the great sort of check on the big companies doing their unknown, possibly evil thing with AI. And you were going to build models that sort of, you know, somehow held them accountable and was capable of slowing the field down, if need be. Or at least that's kind of what I heard. And yet, what's happened, arguably, is the opposite. That your release of GPT, especially ChatGPT, sent such shockwaves through the tech world that now Google and Meta and so forth are all scrambling to catch up. And some of their criticisms have been, you are forcing us to put this out here without proper guardrails or we die. You know, how do you, like, make the case that what you have done is responsible here and not reckless. GB: Yeah, we think about these questions all the time. Like, seriously all the time. And I don't think we're always going to get it right. But one thing I think has been incredibly important, from the very beginning, when we were thinking about how to build artificial general intelligence, actually have it benefit all of humanity, like, how are you supposed to do that, right? And that default plan of being, well, you build in secret, you get this super powerful thing, and then you figure out the safety of it and then you push “go,” and you hope you got it right. I don't know how to execute that plan. Maybe someone else does. But for me, that was always terrifying, it didn't feel right. And so I think that this alternative approach is the only other path that I see, which is that you do let reality hit you in the face. And I think you do give people time to give input. You do have, before these machines are perfect, before they are super powerful, that you actually have the ability to see them in action. And we've seen it from GPT-3, right? GPT-3, we really were afraid that the number one thing people were going to do with it was generate misinformation, try to tip elections. Instead, the number one thing was generating Viagra spam. (Laughter) CA: So Viagra spam is bad, but there are things that are much worse. Here's a thought experiment for you. Suppose you're sitting in a room, there's a box on the table. You believe that in that box is something that, there's a very strong chance it's something absolutely glorious that's going to give beautiful gifts to your family and to everyone. But there's actually also a one percent thing in the small print there that says: “Pandora.” And there's a chance that this actually could unleash unimaginable evils on the world. Do you open that box? GB: Well, so, absolutely not. I think you don't do it that way. And honestly, like, I'll tell you a story that I haven't actually told before, which is that shortly after we started OpenAI, I remember I was in Puerto Rico for an AI conference. I'm sitting in the hotel room just looking out over this wonderful water, all these people having a good time. And you think about it for a moment, if you could choose for basically that Pandora’s box to be five years away or 500 years away, which would you pick, right? On the one hand you're like, well, maybe for you personally, it's better to have it be five years away. But if it gets to be 500 years away and people get more time to get it right, which do you pick? And you know, I just really felt it in the moment. I was like, of course you do the 500 years. My brother was in the military at the time and like, he puts his life on the line in a much more real way than any of us typing things in computers and developing this technology at the time. And so, yeah, I'm really sold on the you've got to approach this right. But I don't think that's quite playing the field as it truly lies. Like, if you look at the whole history of computing, I really mean it when I say that this is an industry-wide or even just almost like a human-development- of-technology-wide shift. And the more that you sort of, don't put together the pieces that are there, right, we're still making faster computers, we're still improving the algorithms, all of these things, they are happening. And if you don't put them together, you get an overhang, which means that if someone does, or the moment that someone does manage to connect to the circuit, then you suddenly have this very powerful thing, no one's had any time to adjust, who knows what kind of safety precautions you get. And so I think that one thing I take away is like, even you think about development of other sort of technologies, think about nuclear weapons, people talk about being like a zero to one, sort of, change in what humans could do. But I actually think that if you look at capability, it's been quite smooth over time. And so the history, I think, of every technology we've developed has been, you've got to do it incrementally and you've got to figure out how to manage it for each moment that you're increasing it. CA: So what I'm hearing is that you ... the model you want us to have is that we have birthed this extraordinary child that may have superpowers that take humanity to a whole new place. It is our collective responsibility to provide the guardrails for this child to collectively teach it to be wise and not to tear us all down. Is that basically the model? GB: I think it's true. And I think it's also important to say this may shift, right? We've got to take each step as we encounter it. And I think it's incredibly important today that we all do get literate in this technology, figure out how to provide the feedback, decide what we want from it. And my hope is that that will continue to be the best path, but it's so good we're honestly having this debate because we wouldn't otherwise if it weren't out there. CA: Greg Brockman, thank you so much for coming to TED and blowing our minds. (Applause)"

He gives a sneak peek of his company's new product -- shown for the first time ever on the TED stage -- and explains how it could change the way we interact with tech and the world around us.","technology, invention, computers, future, communication, AI, machine learning",2023,"I spent 22 incredible years at Apple, helping to design experiences and devices ranging from the Mac to the iPhone to the Apple Watch. And as the power of compute increased, the size of our computers or our devices decreased. The desktop paved the way for extraordinary interconnectedness, but it was stuck to your desk. The laptop provided portability, but you still had to be sitting down to use it. And the smartphone evolved us into the modern, connected humans we are, providing millions the ability to access the internet from our pockets. And the smart watch was a window to that phone. A companion device with a whole host of health insights, all shrunk down to your wrist. But what comes next? Some believe AR/VR glasses like these are the answer, but they merely move the screens we already have in our lives today to being just millimeters away from our eyeballs. A further barrier between you and the world. And the future is not on your face. In fact, in 2017, the legendary tech journalist Walt Mossberg wrote in his final column that he felt that soon, one day, technology would become invisible. And that the computer would disappear. And we agree. (Ringing) Sorry. This is my wife. I'm going to have to get this. Hello? Bethany Bongiorno: Hey, babe. IC: Hey, Bethany. How's it going? BB: Good. Are you at TED? IC: Yeah, I'm on the red circle right now, actually. Bethany: Oh, great, good luck. And don't forget to mention me. (Laughter) IC: I won't, babe, thank you. Bethany: Love you. IC: Love you, too. Bye. It's going to get different in a minute. (Applause) So my wife, Bethany, and our entire company, Humane, have been working to answer the question of what comes next. And you may ask yourself, why? Why would anybody do this? It's because we love building technology that genuinely makes people's lives better. And we believe that artificial intelligence or AI would be the driving force behind the next leap in device design. And there is an incredible amount of stuff that's happening in this space. Huge, huge advancements. And even Bill Gates has said of OpenAI's GPT that it's only the second most revolutionary technology demonstration that he's seen in his entire lifetime. But what do we do with all these incredible developments, and how do we actually harness these to genuinely make our life better? If we get this right, AI will unlock a world of possibility for all of us. And today I want to share with you what we think is a solution to that end. And it's the first time we're doing so openly. It's a new kind of wearable device and platform that's built entirely from the ground up for artificial intelligence. And is completely standalone. You don't need a smartphone or any other device to pair with it. In fact, I'm wearing one right now. And it interacts with the world the way you interact with the world. Hearing what you hear, seeing what you see. While being privacy-first and safe and completely fading into the background of your life. We like to say that the experience is screenless, seamless and sensing, allowing you to access the power of compute while remaining present in your surroundings, fixing a balance that's felt out of place for some time now. And I can't wait to share more details about what we've built, and I will in the next few months. But today I want to talk to you about what it unlocks. And what it means to be able to take AI with you everywhere. And what happens when technology increasingly disappears. Technology becoming invisible affords us new opportunities of how we interact with compute. We've become so accustomed to tapping on an app or moving a cursor with a mouse that it feels second nature. But that's by design. When I was working on the iPhone, I used to test interactions like slide-to-unlock with my infant daughter. She was the best possible focus group. She’s 16 now, and she's got a lot more ideas than she did back then. This also, by the way, is the only non-AI generated image that you'll see from me today. And as I look at it now, I see more than ever why a future driven by AI is far better than a future that would involve more screens. Like this. He's cute, though. But for the human-technology relationship to actually evolve beyond screens, we need something radically different. Let me show you. Where can I find a gift for my wife before I have to leave tomorrow? (Voice) Vancouver's Granville Island is a lively shopping district. IC: That's an incredibly simple response for a very complex query. How often do we find ourselves in a new city, wrestling with our phones, trying not to bump into people, trying to figure out where we're going and where we're supposed to be? It's even harder when we don't speak the language, right? Let me show you something. Invisible devices should feel so natural to use that you almost forget about their existence. (Voice speaking in French) IC: You'll note that's me and my voice, speaking fluent French, using an AI speech model that's part of my own AI. This is not a deepfake. In fact, it's deeply profound. This is my AI giving me the ability to speak any language and you having a chance to hear me speak that language in my own emotion and my own voice. Thank you. (Applause) This is moving away from the experiments that make us all concerned about the direction compute is going in. But it's instead using technology to create real, responsible compute products that are in service to us and built on trust. This is good AI in action. And we spent thousands of hours reimagining and redesigning new types of compute interactions, ranging from complex voice commands to intricate hand gestures, all in service of trying to find more natural ways to interact with compute. Why fumble for your phone when you can just hold an object and ask questions about it? The result almost feels like the entire world becomes your operating system. And when compute disappears, it allows us to get back to what really matters: a new ability to be present. Like riding a bicycle in the park and just ripping through emails or going to a concert without having to hold up your phone to capture it. Or experiencing your toddler's first steps without a screen between you and your child. In the future, technology will be both ambient and contextual. And this means harnessing AI to really understand you and your surroundings in order to achieve the best results. Imagine this. You've been in meetings all day and you just want a summary of what you've missed. Catch me up. (Voice) Patrick is coming to tomorrow's design meeting. Bethany wants to move next week's dinner, and Oliver is asking about soccer this weekend. IC: These are emails, calendar invites and messages, all surfaced up to the top. You can use these to help guide your decision making, manage your workload and sculpt tailored responses in your own voice. And in the context of your life. And we gain this context through machine learning. The more you use our device powered by AI, the more we can help you in all times of need. Your AI effectively becomes an ever-evolving, personalized form of memory. And we think that's amazing. In fact, let's say you're health conscious or you have certain types of food considerations. Let me just show you. Picked up one of these chocolates. Used to eat a ton of these when I was a kid. Can I eat this? (Voice) A milky bar contains cocoa butter. Given your intolerance, you may want to avoid it. IC: So I can’t eat these anymore. (Applause) But what's cool is my AI knows what's best for me. But I'm in total control. I'm going to eat it anyway. (Laughter) (Voice) Enjoy it. (Laughter) IC: Your AI figures out exactly what you need. And by the way, I love that there's no judgment. I think it's amazing to be able to live freely. Your AI figures out what you need at the speed of thought. A sense that will ever be evolving as technology improves too. And these examples are just the start. As AI advances, we will see how it will transform nearly every aspect of our lives. In ways that will seem unimaginable right now. In fact, Sam Altman from OpenAI feels the way we do. And that AI is grossly underestimated. And I'll add, so long as we get it right. We really believe that we're only beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible. Embed advancements of AI, like in our device that's actually built to disappear and allow experiences to come forward, and we open up entirely new possible ways of how you interact with technology and how you interact with the world around you. More humane, intuitive interactions that are screenless, seamless and sensing. This is so much more than devices just getting smaller or more powerful. This is the possibility of reimagining the human-technology relationship as we know it. And that's what's so exciting. It's a huge challenge, no doubt. But it's the world that we want to live in. One where technology not only helps you get back into the world but enhances our ability to do so. It's within reach. And you saw some of it today. The future will not be held in your hand, and it won't be on your face either. The future of technology might almost be invisible. Thank you. (Applause)"

He shares the opportunities he sees for students and educators to collaborate with AI tools -- including the potential of a personal AI tutor for every student and an AI teaching assistant for every teacher -- and demos some exciting new features for their educational chatbot, Khanmigo.","technology, education, AI, teaching, kids",2023,"So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, ""Tell me the answer,"" it says, ""I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?"" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, ""To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame."" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, ""Well, what do you care about?"" And let's say the student says, ""I want to be a professional athlete."" And it says, ""Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc."" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report on ""The Great Gatsby."" And when she was reading ""The Great Gatsby,"" Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, ""Why does he do that?"" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, ""Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, ""Why do you keep staring at the green light?"" ""Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life."" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying ""This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate."" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, ""It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write."" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, ""Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries."" And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, ""Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident."" And the AI says, ""Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,"" etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, ""Does my evidence support my claim?"" And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, ""On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,"" but once again, Socratically says, ""Can you tell us why?"" So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, ""The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step."" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, ""Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,"" what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you. (Applause)"

She brings this harrowing norm to light, exploring its harms and offering a more equitable process for colleges everywhere.","education, race, success, personal growth, self, mental health, writing, identity, TEDx, youth",2023,"There's a story of mine that I've told about a million different times, and it goes a little something like this. When I was 10, my family and I packed up our entire lives into large suitcases and dragged them across the Pacific to a foreign land called Canada. I was put in a school where I was the only Asian kid in my grade, and I got teased for my broken English, Asian features and funny smelling ethnic lunches. The racism was a real doozy. But don't feel bad. Through the magical healing powers of extracurricular activities and pure perseverance, I stand before you today, a new woman: healthy, healed and extremely employable. You wouldn't even be able to tell from just looking at me that I was once the weird little immigrant girl who begged her mom to pack PB&amp;J sandwiches so she wouldn't have to eat lunch alone in the bathroom. This is a story that I’ve told in academic essays, job interviews and even in the very application that got me into this fine university. It's also a story that, despite all of its truth, I've come to hate. Now this is a story that I don't have copyright claim over. It's one that continues to be regurgitated by immigrant kids all across the country to be served on a silver platter to prestigious universities who chew these stories and spit out acceptance letters in return. The contents of the story may change. Instead of a difficult immigration experience, it might be the death of a loved one, a chronic illness or a racist encounter. But what remains constant is the moral: A bad thing happened to me, but it made me a good person. This is part of a larger phenomenon that I'm here to talk about today. The overwhelming pressure being put on high school students to write about their deepest traumas in their college applications with the hopes that they seem resilient and interesting enough to be given a spot. I believe that these are not only bad metrics by which to evaluate applicants, but also incredibly harmful to the storyteller themselves and risks reinforcing existing inequities in higher education. There's also pressure that's being amplified by admissions counselors themselves who play a huge role in influencing what applicants decide to write about. Take, for example, this tip from the MIT admissions blog, where the author compares two different introductions for a potential essay. The first one reads: ""I'm honored to apply for the Master of Library Science program at the University of Okoboji. For as long as I can remember, I've had a love affair with books. Since I was 11, I've wanted to be a librarian."" The second introduction reads: ""When I was 11, my great aunt Gretchen passed away and left me something that changed my life: a library of about 5000 books. Some of my best days were spent arranging and reading her books. Since then, I've wanted to become a librarian."" The author notes that the second introduction is much more striking and leaves a much better impression. Consider another tip from collegeessayguy.com, where he advises students to “get personal.” He says, ""Weirdly, including painful memories and what you learned from them usually helps a personal statement meet the goals of a college application essay. You come off as humble, accessible, likable and mature.” Confessions from admissions officers themselves can also be telling. Aya Waller-Bey, a former admissions officer from Georgetown University, said in a ""Forbes"" article that, ""Within months on the job, I saw how the personal statements of Black and other racially minoritized students differed from those of white applicants. Black students highlighted resilience through stories of survival, while their counterparts wrote casual essays about service abroad and sporting championships. Black students shared their pain, white students shared their passions.” Now, lastly, and perhaps the least reliable source is my own life. I remember feeling this way when I was applying to universities. Like I had no other choice, no other experiences worthy of mentioning and no other merit beyond the fact that I had thrived despite what I had gone through. I even remember worrying that my tale wouldn't be harrowing enough after hearing from a counselor that writing about immigration has become a bit of a cliche because of how overused it is. So what’s the universities’ role in all of this and why are these stories even harmful to begin with? Well, I believe that using your college application essay to discuss your trauma actually doesn't help you process it. And there are a couple different reasons why. First, writing about a difficult experience is, as you may have guessed, difficult. Not only do you have to relive the event itself, but you also have to actively suppress any negative emotions that arise during the process. That kind of emotional labor can be taxing for anybody, but perhaps especially so for these young applicants who haven't had enough time on this world to process the terrible things that have happened to them. For that space to be one in which they're confessing to a faceless stranger who gets to make the most consequential decision of their adolescent life imposes an incredibly heavy psychological burden. I mean, imagine if you walked into your therapy appointment and your therapist tells you that they're not going to respond to anything you tell them except with a rejection or acceptance email sent months later. And also that whatever you tell them will determine the trajectory of your entire academic and professional career. Hard to imagine that being therapeutic. Secondly, the trauma essay makes one assumption that is extremely problematic. It's not always the learning opportunity through which you can gain more confidence or develop better time management skills. Sometimes it's just a sucky thing that really sucks. And asking students to prove how they turn their pain into progress ignores this truth and falls prey to the toxic positivity narrative that everything happens for a reason, ignoring the very valid resentment and anger that many victims still feel. Lastly, the things we write aren't just informed by our experiences, they shape how we view those experiences as well. And if we're writing about our trauma to prove to an admissions officer that we are worthy of a decent education, then it becomes necessary to sanitize our pain, to make it marketable and strategic, to scrub away all the suffering, so all that's left is what will fit into the narrow margins of what is palatable. And this is what I see as being the fundamental contradiction at the heart of the trauma essay. It seems to give the writer free reign on vulnerability, but actually leaves them very little room to be vulnerable. Your story has to be just sad enough that it gains sympathy, but not so sad that it makes you seem beyond help. Just critical enough to inspire change, but not so much that it actually criticizes systemic structures. Just honest enough to seem real, but not so unfiltered that it creates discomfort. The protagonist also overcomes whatever struggle they're facing by the end of the 500 word count, instilling the reader with a sense of optimism that despite our deeply unequal society, it is possible to rise through the ranks and overcome all the “-isms.” This, of course, is not the reality of our world today. And for me, this looked like settling for the familiar story of the stinky lunch, one that's been told so many times that it's devoid of any real meaning, instead of talking about the ongoing social and political disenfranchisement of immigrants, the permanent loss of cultural identity that I suffered, or the sense of disbelonging that still haunts me every time I make a grammar mistake or someone mispronounces my name. These are all struggles that never really go away, but are carefully tucked away in my essay because they don't fit the linear narrative that is being constructed. But how are universities to blame for all of this? I mean, they never explicitly asked students to trauma-dump in their essays, and many admissions experts have actually come out and discouraged discussing explicit trauma in essays. However, I still don't think that universities are blameless. The reason why the trauma essay is so ubiquitous is because it seems to be working. Anne Trubek, who helped low-income high school students at Oberlin College write their essays, expresses the ethical dilemma that she faces. ""By pushing students to reveal their horror stories, I risk taking away their dignity, but by not pushing, I could be hindering their chances of getting into their dream school."" Whether trauma essays and acceptance letters are actually causally correlated is impossible to tell from the outside. So this could all just be speculation and myth. But in failing to resolutely clear up these speculations and myths about whether trauma essays are rewarded or discouraged, universities are indirectly enabling the rise of the trauma essay and all of its harmful implications. So what are they to do about all of this? Well, first of all, I think that this is a problem that goes much deeper than individual universities, and even perhaps the institution of higher education itself. It's rooted in the cultural obsession with appropriating trauma and making it consumable, as well as the systemic tendency to tokenize oppressed people and their experiences. But there are still things that universities can do to make things better. First, they can be more transparent about their admissions guidelines. If it's really true that they don't want to reward trauma storytelling just for the sake of it, then they should be more forthcoming about this expectation. They could also restructure their prompts to avoid putting pressure on students to talk about past hardships and adversities and instead refocus prompts to ask students about their goals for the future and their academic interests. Secondly, admissions counselors should be trauma-informed and trained in working with BIPOC folk. As the unofficial gatekeepers to the secrets of getting into your dream college, they should wield their power responsibly and not pressure students to talk about traumatic experiences that they're not yet ready to talk about. Lastly -- and this one's for anyone who's actually applying to a postsecondary institution sometime soon -- remember that you are more than the bad things that happened to you. I know that when it seems like every other classmate of yours is writing an essay that could be adapted for an HBO original drama, that you may feel like your experiences are not worth talking about. But I promise that they are. You just have to find your voice and use it. Now as much as I don't want to live that nail-bitingly stressful time of my life ever again, I can't help but wonder: what would I have written about if I got the chance to apply to UBC again? This time absent the pressure to strategically use my immigrant background to gain sympathy points. Maybe I would have written about how I overcame my fear of public speaking and became comfortable with being the loudest voice in the room. Or I could have written about watching trashy reality television is what first sparked my interest in political science. Or maybe I still would have written about my immigrant story because that was a big part of my life journey and still impacts me to this day. But I would have done it on my own terms. Instead of being written as a one-dimensional, trauma-turned-triumph trauma drama, I would have been able to tell a story that actually reflects who I am today and acknowledge the fact that my journey is ongoing and it doesn't begin or end with my racial identity. This is the kind of ownership that I wish for everyone to one day have over their story. And now it's up for universities to decide whether they get to tell it. Thank you."
https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_kennedy_the_single_most_important_parenting_strategy?referrer=playlist-the_most_popular_ted_talks_of_2023&autoplay=true,The single most important parenting strategy,Everyone loses their temper from time to time — but the stakes are dizzyingly high when the focus of your fury is your own child. Clinical psychologist and renowned parenting whisperer Becky Kennedy is here to help. Not only does she have practical advice to help parents manage the guilt and shame of their not-so-great moments but she also models the types of conversations you can have to be a better parent. (Hint: this works in all other relationships too.) Bottom line? It's never too late to reconnect.,"psychology, relationships, communication, parenting, personal growth, mental health",2023,"Alright, quick poll -- raise your hand if you have a relationship in your life that's meaningful to you. OK, I assumed, but always good to check our assumptions. (Laughter) I’m saying this because while I'll be focusing today on a parent-child relationship, please know that everything I'm talking about is applicable to any meaningful relationship. So with that in mind, let's jump in. So it's Sunday night, I'm in my kitchen. I just finished cooking dinner for my family, and I am on edge. I mean, I'm exhausted, I haven't been sleeping well. I’m anxious about the upcoming workweek, I'm overwhelmed by all the items on my unfinished to-do list. And then, my son walks into the kitchen. He looks at the table and whines, ""Chicken again?"" (Laughter) ""Disgusting."" (Laughter) And that's it. I snap. I look at him and I yell, ""What is wrong with you? Can you be grateful for one thing in your life?"" And things get worse from there. He screams, ""I hate you."" He runs out of the room and he slams his bedroom door. And now, my self-loathing session begins, as I say to myself, ""What is wrong with me? I've messed up my kid forever."" Well, if you're a parent, you've probably felt that pain. For me, it comes with an extra layer of shame. I mean, I’m a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people become better parents. (Laughter) And yet, this is true as well -- there is no such thing as a perfect parent. Mistakes and struggles, they come with the job, but no one tells us what to do next. Do we just move on? Kind of just pretend the whole thing never happened? Or if I say something, what are the words? Well, for years, as a clinical psychologist in private practice, I saw client after client struggle with this question. And now, as the creator of the parenting content and community platform ""Good Inside,"" I see millions of parents around the globe struggle with this issue. All parents yell. No one knows what to do next. Well, I'm determined to fill this gap. After all, there's almost nothing within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as repair. Whenever a parent asks me, ""What one parenting strategy should I focus on?"" I always say the same thing: ""Get good at repair."" So what is repair? Repair is the act of going back to a moment of disconnection. Taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact it had on another. And I want to differentiate a repair from an apology, because when an apology often looks to shut a conversation down -- “Hey, I’m sorry I yelled. Can we move on now?” -- a good repair opens one up. And if you think about what it means to get good at repair, there's so much baked-in realism and hope and possibility. Repair assumes there's been a rupture. So to repair, you have to mess up or fall short of someone else's expectations. Which means the next time I snap at my kid, or my husband, or my work colleague, instead of berating myself, like I did that night in the kitchen, I try to remind myself I'm focusing on getting good at repair. Step one is rupture. ""Check that off, I crushed it."" (Laughter) Step two is repair. ""I can do this. I'm actually right on track."" So let's get back to my example. I'm in the kitchen, my son is in his room. Well, what will happen if I don't repair? That’s really important to understand and helps us make a decision about what to do next. Well, here are the facts. My son is alone, overwhelmed and in a state of distress, because, let's face it, his mom just became scary mom. And now, he has to figure out a way to get back to feeling safe and secure. And if I don't go help him do that through making a repair, he has to rely on one of the only coping mechanisms he has at his own disposal ... self-blame. Self-blame sounds like this: “Something’s wrong with me. I’m unlovable. I make bad things happen.” Ronald Fairbairn may have said it best when he wrote that, for kids, it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil. In other words, it's actually adaptive for a child to internalize badness and fault, because at least then, they can hold onto the idea that their parents and the world around them is safe and good. And while self-blame works for us in childhood, we all know it works against us in adulthood. “Something’s wrong with me. I make bad things happen. I’m unlovable.” These are the core fears of so many adults. But really, we see here, they are actually the childhood stories we wrote when we were left alone following distressing events that went unrepaired. Plus, adults with self-blame are vulnerable to depression, anxiety, deep feelings of worthlessness -- none of which we want for our kids. And we can do better. And it doesn't mean we have to be perfect. When you repair, you go further than removing a child's story of self-blame. You get to add in all the elements that were missing in the first place. Safety, connection, coherence, love, goodness. It's as if you're saying to a child, ""I will not let this chapter of your life end in self-blame. Yes, this chapter will still contain the event of yelling, but I can ensure this chapter has a different ending, and therefore a different title, and theme and lesson learned."" We know that memory is original events combined with every other time you've remembered that event. This is why therapy's helpful, right? When you remember painful experiences from your past within a safer and more connected relationship, the event remains, but your story of the event, it changes, and then you change. With repair, we effectively change the past. So let's write a better story. Let's learn how to repair. Step one, repair with yourself. That's right. I mean, you can't offer compassion or groundedness or understanding to someone else before you access those qualities within yourself. Self-repair means separating your identity, who you are, from your behavior, what you did. For me, it means telling myself two things are true. I’m not proud of my latest behavior and my latest behavior doesn't define me. Even as I struggle on the outside, I remain good inside. I can then start to see that I'm a good parent -- identity -- who was having a hard time -- behavior. And no, this doesn't let me off the hook. This is precisely what leaves me on the hook for change. Because now that I've replaced my spiral with groundedness, I can actually use my energy toward thinking about what I want to do differently the next time. Oh, and I can now use my energy to go repair with my son. Step two -- repair with your child. There's no exact formula. I often think about three elements: name what happened, take responsibility, state what you would do differently the next time. It could come together like this. ""Hey. I keep thinking about what happened the other night in the kitchen. I'm sorry I yelled. I'm sure that felt scary. And it wasn't your fault. I'm working on staying calm, even when I'm frustrated."" A 15-second intervention can have a lifelong impact. I've replaced my child's story of self-blame with a story of self-trust and safety and connection. I mean, what a massive upgrade. And to give a little more clarity around how to repair, I want to share a few examples of what I call ""not repair,"" which are things that come more naturally to most of us -- definitely me included. ""Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you in the kitchen, but if you wouldn't have complained about dinner, it wouldn't have happened."" (Laughter) Been there? Been there? OK. Or ""You know, you really need to be grateful for things in your life, like a home-cooked meal. Then, you won't get yelled at."" (Laughter) Not only do these interventions fail at the goal of reconnection, they also insinuate that your child caused your reaction, which simply isn’t true and isn't a model of emotion regulation we want to pass on to the next generation. (Applause) So let's say we've all resisted the ""it was your fault, anyway"" not-repairs, and have instead prioritized a repair that allows us to reconnect. What might the impact be? What might that look like in adulthood? My adult child won’t spiral in self-blame when they make a mistake, and won’t take on blame for someone else’s mistake. My adult child will know how to take responsibility for their behavior, because you've modeled how to take responsibility for yours. Repairing with a child today sets the stage for these critical adult relationship patterns. Plus, it gets better -- now that I've reconnected with my son, I can do something really impactful. I can teach him a skill he didn't have in the first place, which is how kids actually change their behavior. So maybe the next day, I say ""You know, you're not always going to like what I make for dinner. Instead of saying 'that's disgusting,' I wonder if you could say 'not my favorite.'"" Now I'm teaching him how to regulate his understandable disappointment, and communicate effectively and respectfully with another person. That never would have happened if instead, I had been blaming him for my reaction. So here's the point where you might have a lingering concern. Maybe you're thinking, ""You know, I have a feeling that my kid's older than your kid."" (Laughter) ""I think it's too late."" Or ""I have done a lot worse than you did in the kitchen."" (Laughter) ""Maybe it's too late."" Well, I mean this -- if you have only one takeaway from this talk, please let this be it: It is not too late. It is never too late. How do I know? Well, imagine, right after this, you get a call from one of your parents, and if neither of your parents are alive, imagine finding and opening a letter you hadn't seen till that moment. OK, walk through this with me, here's the call. ""Hey, I know this sounds out of the blue, but I've been thinking a lot about your childhood. And I think there were a lot of moments that felt really bad to you. And you are right to feel that way. Those moments weren't your fault. They were times when I was struggling, and if I could have gone back, I would have stepped aside, I would have calmed myself down, and then found you to help you with whatever you were struggling with. I'm sorry. And if you're ever willing to talk to me about any of those moments, I'll listen. I won't listen to have a rebuttal. I'll listen to understand. I love you."" I don't know many adults who don't have a fairly visceral reaction to that exercise. I often hear, “Why am I crying?” Or ""Listen, that wouldn't change everything. But it might change some things."" Well, I definitely do not specialize in math, but here's something I know with certainty. If you have a child, that child is younger than you are. (Laughter) Always true. The story of their life is shorter and even more amenable to editing. So if that imagined exercise had an impact on you, imagine the impact an actual repair will have on your child. See? I told you, it's never too late. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

How a conspiracy takes flight,"Peter McIndoe isn't a fan of birds. In fact, he has a theory about them that might shock you. Listen along to this eye-opening talk as it takes a turn and makes a larger point about conspiracies, truth and belonging in divisive times.","social change, relationships, communication, community, United States, personal growth",2023,"Hi, I'm Peter. And six years ago, I received information that changed the course of the rest of my life. From 1969 through 2001, the US government murdered over 12 billion birds in the American skies. They did this using poisonous toxins dropped from airplanes that was contagious and murdered all of the birds over the course of about 40 years. Now, I know this is not the public understanding of this and may sound absurd, but please just bear with me and keep an open mind and just be respectful, please, as I share this information with you. I know a lot of you may be wondering why would the government kill 12 billion birds? It seems like an awful lot of trouble for a government to go through. The reason is as devastating as it is simple. For each bird the government killed, they replaced it with a surveillance drone replica in disguise designed to spy on the American people. Now ... Some may say, if you're the government, at least, that this is a worthy sacrifice, these 12 billion lives, for the safety of the people, right? I don't know about that, it seems like a pretty serious limit on our freedom, wouldn't you agree? The proof that birds are robots is all around us, if you start looking. For starters, birds charge their batteries on power lines -- (Laughter) So they can refuel up high and they can watch the civilians, you know. They also track civilians using a liquid tracking device. (Laughter) You ever wonder why birds poop on your car? Do you need more evidence? Really, I can go all day up here. Who here has seen a baby pigeon? You haven't, have you? It's weird. There's all these adult pigeons where are all the babies? They come out of the factory as adults, so ... (Laughter) There's no organic growth, you know. It's a smoking gun. Over the years, as I began putting this information together, I began realizing the extent of all this. And there were times I wished I never even learned this. My life would be so much easier. You know, I remember before I knew this information, I was happier, my steps were lighter, you know. But I always come back to this. It is my moral obligation as one of the few privileged enough to know this, to share it with you, the blind sheep, you know. (Laughter) And that's what I've been doing for years now. I'm a part of a movement called Birds Aren't Real. And in 2021, I was promoted to public information officer for the movement. It's the honor of my life. I had one job. Oh, thank you, thank you. (Applause) Thank you. My one job was to deprogram the public from the bird lie. And deprogram is a very specific word because you all are programmed. You know that, right? We live in a pro-bird civilization drenched in propaganda. For instance, every state has a state bird, the national mascot is a bald eagle, presidents don't talk, they tweet, then the tweets are covered on the bird-logo media. Once I knew this, my first order of business was to get the information out to the American people, get off the internet into the real world. So that's what I did. I bought a van, covered it in decals with facts. I wanted to turn the highway into an information highway, awaken the people. I went city to city, holding rallies, meeting up with our thousands of supporters, growing by the day. And I was putting up billboards wherever we went, sharing our simple but powerful message. Look how beautiful it is. Now, the government, (Laughter) the government did take note of what we were doing and they sent some intimidators to try and deter us from our mission. You can see them right there. (Laughter) But we did not fold. We kept on going. We started holding rallies at some of the most evil pro-bird corporations in the world, starting with Twitter, where we brought hundreds out to protest their pro-bird logo. Months later, we brought 500 people out to CNN headquarters to demand fairer coverage for bird truthers on air. Then just last year, we brought 2,000 people out to Washington Square in New York City to demand that the mayor shut down every pigeon in the city. (Laughter) Here's what that looked like. (Crowd shouting) Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! (Laughter) Can't even tell you how that felt. I took that video standing on the top of the van, megaphone in hand, knowing we were awakening a country that needs it so badly. I can't think of anything more beautiful. OK, let me start this talk over. I do not actually believe that birds are robots. And everyone else in this picture is also in on the bit. This is a character that I played for four years. The leader of a fake movement with fake evidence and a fake history. Our goal was to convince the public that our satirical movement was a real one. And see if the media would believe what we were saying. To do this, I played this character that I just showed you. We held rallies, put up billboards. We even sent the media a lot of fake evidence. We hired an old actor to pose as an ex-CIA agent confessing to his crimes. We sent them a historic email leak called ""Poultry Gate"" that came out of the Pentagon, (Laughter) where we forged hundreds of fake emails exposing elites and government officials in the bird drone surveillance plot. It didn't take much to convince the media. After just one summer holding rallies like this, it became nationally syndicated news on tons of local news stations that we were a real movement that had been around for 50 years. And there was a resurgence happening where it was coming back and there was a radical new leader, myself, bringing the movement back as the rise of conspiracy theories swept the nation. At this point, I'm sitting on my couch, watching the media report on my fake movement as a real one and figure it is probably time to come out of character. One, because we'd accomplished what we came there to do. But also, I didn't want this to snowball in anything that was never supposed to. So in 2021, I broke character, revealed the movement was a farce on the front page of The New York Times. And I was very proud, as you can see. Allow me to reintroduce myself one more time. Hi, I'm Peter. Can you say, ""Hi, Peter?"" (Audience) Hi, Peter. Hey. I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in Arkansas in Little Rock, where I was home-schooled on the outskirts of town. The community that I grew up with was hyper conservative and religious, and almost everyone that I knew believed in some form of conspiracy theory, whether it was that Obama was the Antichrist or that there are microchips in the vaccines. During my entire life, I always felt like I was on the fringes of normal society. So, as you can imagine, when it became time for me to play a character, the conspiracy theorist was a pretty easy one for me to tap into. During the years in character, I used the same cadence, logic and arguments as those I grew up around, just with a different theory swapped in. I was really dedicated to playing this character as convincingly as I could, as method as possible. So I spent days, sometimes, in character, a lot of time out in public with the van there, just talking with strangers. It led to hundreds of interactions with strangers who thought that I was a real conspiracy theorist. I'd often be out there, cowboy hat on, handing out fliers that said things like, ""If it flies, it's spies."" (Laughter) We had another flyer that said, ""Birdwatching goes both ways."" (Laughter) And during these times, as I'm handing out flyers and talking with people, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of instances over the years where strangers would approach me. You know, they'd see me in public and I'd see them notice me. And walk up to me with complete disdain on their face. They thought that I was a real conspiracy theorist. And time and time again, they'd come up to me, look me right in the eyes, just as close as I am to you right here, and they would tell me how stupid I am. They'd tell me I was uneducated, that I was crazy. That I was the problem with this country. When this happens, I didn't feel the emotions of the character that I thought I would. My out-of-character self may interpret these interactions as a funny response to someone that fell for the comedy project, but instead I felt the emotions of the character. I felt emboldened and I felt sad and angry. Like they didn't even take the time to know me. They instantly condemned me, judged me and othered me. I'd found myself on the opposite side of this equation that I'd grown up around, the normal and the fringe. And in those moments when those people were talking to me, they could not have been more ineffective at what I would assume they really want. Less conspiracy theorists in the world. These experiences, hundreds of them over the years, watching how people interact with those on the fringes of our society gave me an entirely new perspective on our approach to conspiracy theorists, whether it's how we frame them in the conventional media, to how we deal with those in our own lives. If our goal is to live in a shared reality with our neighbors, what if our current approach isn't bringing us any closer to that? What if by talking to conspiracy theorists like they're ignorant and stupid, we're actually pushing them farther away from the truth that we want them to see? Because what happens when someone tells you that you're stupid, you're all wrong, you're the problem? You'll feel judged and dismissed. And most importantly, you’ll feel othered, which may lead you to look for safety in those who are like-minded to do what they have been doing for you. Affirm your selfhood, give you a sense of identity, belonging. These are some of the most basic human desires. We have to consider that conspiracy theorists are not just joining these groups for no reason. They're getting rewards out of these, things that we are all looking for, a sense of purpose, community. I grew up with the internet and during my time with this project, especially out of character, people have talked to me about the misinformation age and this, you know, terrifying problem of online echo chambers and conspiracy theorists. But I want to remind us that there are humans behind a lot of these screens. It's not just numbers. Everyone’s unique experience influences their own narrative about the world, and there's no blueprint for how to deal with this yet. But I do not think that online echo chambers of conspiracy theorists are this inevitable symptom of life online. The internet is about 30 years old and things are changing quickly, and I think it'll be very important that we develop new solutions for these new problems on a fundamental level. What if by addressing belief before belonging, we're starting the conversation at the wrong place? Instead of sitting in collective bewilderment and frustration about how these people could believe these things, these crazies, what if we first looked under the hood and thought about what made them vulnerable to this information in the first place? What might they be getting out of this that they're not getting in their everyday lives? How much does it have to do with a different truth, or how much does it have to do with the community that that truth brings? We need to think about people's circumstances and reference points, to see them as fellow human beings who want to believe in something and want to belong, just like all of us do in this room. Because if we continue with our current approach of arguing on the level of belief, it's not going to get us anywhere. We're going to end up with more echo chambers, more disinformation and more polarization. Instead, we can do the harder work of looking into what is fueling the need for an alternate truth. Not only would this lend us more empathy for those who think differently than us, but I really think this might be the only actually productive means, productive means, of moving toward the shared reality that we all want to live in. Let's direct our energy toward the crisis of belonging. And then maybe we will understand the crisis of belief. Before I go, I'll leave with one more word. Just don’t forget: if it flies, it's spies. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

But she didn't always know if she'd make it big. In a lively talk sparkling with actionable advice, she shares how her struggles taught her what it takes to believe in herself -- and how we can all find the self-confidence to keep moving forward.","entertainment, success, motivation, personal growth, goals",2023,"(Singing) I am an endangered species (Applause and cheers) But I sing no victim song. I am a woman. I am an artist. And I know where my voice ... belongs. (Applause and cheers) Now, you might have heard me sing that song. It was September 12th, 2022, right after Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers said, ""And the winner is, Sheryl Lee Ralph!"" What!? I had just won the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a comedy for my role as Mrs. Barbara Howard on your favorite TV show, ""Abbott Elementary."" (Cheers) Oh, yes. And I was shocked. As the children would say, shooketh into disbelief. Oh, my goodness, it was my first time at the Emmys and I won. Yes! And I got to tell you, in that moment, I was so stunned into disbelief that I don't know how I got up on the stage. There I was, just listening to that roar of applause. Mm mm mm. And my whole career flashed right there in front of me. Starting with 19-year-old Sheryl Lee in her first movie being directed by the great Sidney Poitier. Oh, yeah, you can clap that. (Applause) Followed by ten years of “no” after “no” after “no.” Before the next film role came about. But I filled in that time with TV and more ""nos"" and more rejection until I made it big on Broadway in what has become the iconic musical of the '80s, because I say so, (Laughter) ""Dreamgirls."" (Applause) And boy, did I learn a lot of life lessons there. And I mean, after so many moments of doubt, disbelief, there I was, on that Emmy stage, with this huge sign in front of me flashing ""Stop now,"" ""Stop now,"" ""Stop now."" And I started to think, “My God, what if I had stopped after all of those ‘nos?’ What if I had stopped after all of those moments of feeling defeated? What if I had stopped?"" I wouldn't be standing there for that golden moment. But right now, many of us, we are feeling ... deeply challenged trying to hold on and believe in ourselves, and I do not mean in a toxic way. I am talking about a way that comes from confidence, the kind of confidence that can keep us moving forward when we are feeling like we are carrying the weight of the pandemic, trying to figure out all of this political division, fighting all of the mental, physical, social violence in our homes, in our communities, to climate change, social media. It's a lot. Making it hard to believe in the goodness in the world. And harder still to believe in the goodness of ourselves. This is a rough time, people, and our mental health is suffering. We all need a checkup from the neck up. (Laughter) And I don't mean -- yeah, it's OK. You feel me, thank you. (Applause) And I don't mean just medicine. I actually mean reframing our thinking of our ability to believe in ourselves. Now I know, you see me on TV, in magazines, on movie screens, and you might be thinking to yourself, ""What does she know about struggling to believe in herself?"" Well, let me tell you something. I do not look like my journey. (Laughter) (Applause) Oh, I've been through a few things. And the struggle is real. But I have learned something in my life. That there are three things that we all must do in order to believe in ourselves. Number one. First, we need to see ourselves. I mean, really, truly, deeply see ourselves for who and what we are in order to believe in ourselves. I’m a child of the ’60s, and that was hard. Oh. In the third grade, I tested out of public school into a fancy private school where the only Black person I saw every day was the one who looked back at me in the mirror. I was by myself, and I was all alone. And the things that were said to me, and I'm not talking about just the kids, but the adults, too. And when I would come home from school crying the ugly cry, my immigrant Jamaican mother would sit me down in front of the mirror and ask me, ""Do you see an N-word? Do you see a liar? Do you see a big-lip monkey? No! So dry your eyes. And when you go back to school, remember, you are rubber, they are glue. And every ignorant thing they say about you bounces off of you and sticks to them."" (Applause) And I believed her. And it didn't hurt. So much. Because I believed. Number two. We've got to think. Think about ourselves in order to believe in ourselves. Growing up, my dad had a sign on his desk. And it said, ""Think."" ""Think."" Oh, I did not know how valuable and powerful the simple act of thinking was until I came back to Hollywood from my triumphant run on Broadway, and I had this meeting with a big studio Hollywood casting director. Oh, I was so excited. I walked in and he looked at me and he said, ""Hm. Everybody knows you're a beautiful, talented Black girl. But what do I do with a beautiful, talented Black girl? Do I put you in a movie with Tom Cruise? Does he kiss you? Ugh. Who goes to see that movie?"" (Laughs) I could not believe that that man had just said that to me, to my face. And he hurt me. He hurt me so deeply, I was actually thinking about quitting. Until ... I started to think. And I thought about what he said. He said that everybody knew that I was a beautiful, talented Black girl. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) And that I deserve to be cast in movies with the likes of Tom Cruise, and he should kiss me. (Applause) (Laughs) So what was meant to break me did not break me, it built me up. I believed that man, I believed what he said. And I walked out of there giving myself permission to take up space in Hollywood, knowing that I belonged there no matter what anybody thought about me. (Cheers and applause) Thirdly. We've got to act like we believe in ourselves. Oh, yeah. Because when we believe in ourselves and act on it, we create possibilities that never would have been possible had we not just believed. OK, so I will tell you another story. I will never forget walking into one of those crowded Hollywood rooms, and I see Harry Thomason, producer Harry Thomason, who is married to Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, writer, creator of the series ""Designing Women."" I walk right up to Harry and I say, ""How can it be, that after all of these years Anthony has not had a relationship with a Black woman? After all, the show takes place in Atlanta, Georgia."" (Laughter) He looked at me, took a step back and said, ""Who are you?"" I said, ""I'm Sheryl Lee Ralph."" And he said, ""OK. Have your people call my people and we will see what we can do."" And guess what happened? (Laughter) I got cast as Etienne Toussaint Bouvier, Las Vegas showgirl turned Anthony's wife for the final season of ""Designing Women."" (Cheers and applause) Oh, yeah. Against all odds, once again, I gave myself permission to take up space, believing that I belonged. I believed that if Sheryl Lee did the work of honing her craft, building solid relationships and stayed ready so she didn't have to get ready, anything was possible. Heck, winning an Emmy. A Grammy. An Oscar. A Tony. EGOT it, baby. (Cheering) So ... When you leave this room today, I challenge all of you to start a meaningful practice of looking in the mirror and loving what you see. Believe in what you see. If you can't love it, then respect it. And if you can't respect it, then encourage it. If you can't encourage it, empower it. And if you can't empower it, please be kind to it. (Applause) The greatest relationship, the greatest one you will ever have is with yourself. Believe me. Have faith in yourself. Believing that faith can make broken wings fly. And we deserve to soar. Remember, maybe one of these days when you pass the mirror and you catch a glimpse of yourself, remember, I told you this. That is what believing looks like. And don't you ever, ever, ever give up on you. I am Sheryl Lee Ralph, and I love you just the way you are. (Singing) Believe in yourself As I believe in you Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

Hip-hop artist Cordae tells how he went from mixtape-dropping high school kid to Grammy-nominated music star whose ""Hi Level"" mindset helps him achieve his dreams.","culture, music, creativity, storytelling, motivation, personal growth, goals",2022,"How's everybody doing today? (Applause) So for those of you who may not know who I am, which is probably the vast majority of you all. (Laughter) My name is Cordae. I'm 24 years old. I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. but was raised majority in Suitland, Maryland, which made me who I am today. I'm a hip-hop artist. More specifically, a Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist. (Applause) A quote unquote critically acclaimed, world-renowned B-list celebrity. (Laughter) But to be honest, more like B minus. But again, you all can just call me Cordae and assume that I'm almost kind of a big deal because I am here doing a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now I know what you're thinking. What does a 24-year-old rapper possibly have to say during a TED Talk? Like, who cares what Ja Rule thinks, you know? But I'm here to talk about my mantra and my way of life that has gotten me this far and can hopefully take me a lot further on my journey, as I'm just getting started. And that’s the “Hi Level mindset.” Now before I get into the details about the Hi Level mindset, I want to tell you about the original creator of the Hi Level mindset. And that's my mom. She doesn't even know it. My mom had me when she was 16 years old. She was a single mom with all the odds stacked against her. And yet, from an unbiased perspective, I like to say she did a pretty decent job. We lived in some pretty terrible neighborhoods, man. I switched elementary schools about five different times. I remember one time her car had got stolen twice in one week. She overcame circumstance, obstacles, her environment and negativity. As I watched, our living situations would continue to get better and better as the years went by. Now that's Hi Level. Now the Hi Level mindset wasn’t something that she directly taught me or purposefully instilled in me, but something I learned simply by observation. The Hi Level mindset is a philosophy. It’s a wavelength to apply to your everyday thoughts and regiment. The Hi Level mindset will be of great service to you, especially when things aren't going as planned. These trying times that I speak of, or life testers, if you may, are what truly make us man and woman. Actually scratch that. How we handle these lifetimes, these trying times, or life testers, is what decides a person's destiny. Which brings me to step one of the Hi Level mindset. And that's always remain positive, no matter what people or life may throw at you. Now I'm going to give you a little bit of background about myself. Funny enough, I was actually voted most likely to be famous in both middle school and high school. Now I know what you're thinking. I'm sorry. I haven't always been this good looking, it takes a little bit of time. (Laughter) My goal was to graduate high school and to immediately blow up. But that didn't happen. So I went to college and as soon as I went to college, boy, did life hit me hard. Within the first couple of weeks of school, one of my best friends that I called my brother had gotten sentenced to 24 years in prison. I had gotten detained for driving with a suspended license, amongst other things, like having a pound of weed in the car before it was legal. And my grandmother had passed. Not to mention I was already a terrible student with horrific grades and a broke teenager. And I wonder why my grades were so bad. Now that's just disrespectful. I wasn't even trying to hide it. But on top of all of these things, what was really the breaking point for me was that I had released a mixtape that I worked on the entire summer and it had only gotten 200 downloads. Now my previous two mixtapes got 2,000 downloads, so I was not happy with the regression, to say the least. Again, this almost pushed me to the brink of quitting and insanity. But the Hi Level mindset made me think, ""Man. These misfortunes are just going to make my triumph story a lot cooler."" (Laughter) I used this as fuel to the fire, motivation, if you will. It made me think, you know, life is just a book. Not every chapter is going to be perfect. But it's about how it ends. Which brings me to the second step of the Hi Level mindset. Always be intentional with your desires. Know exactly what you want. In 2018, I created a vision board -- at the beginning of 2018, excuse me -- I created a vision board. And I'm proud to say that with the Hi Level mindset, within one year I almost accomplished everything on here. Ya’ll can clap for that. (Applause) So I encourage you to just write down your goals. Starting off your day with reading your goals and dreams aloud gives you a boost of positive energy. This energy can be transmuted into something we call faith. Faith in your ability, faith in yourself, faith in a higher power will take you to places you can't even imagine. Know exactly what you want. How can you be Hi Level if you don't know what Hi Level is to you? And in order to do all these things, it brings me to the third step of the Hi Level mindset. Discipline. Growing up, discipline was always taught in such a lame way that I always tried my best to avoid it. (Laughter) But where motivation is low, that's where discipline kicks in. Anybody who's done something noteworthy with their lives all have one thing in common, and that's discipline. Mastering the art of discipline will literally change your life. I witnessed this close hand by studying a friend up close. This friend of mine noticed that every time he stopped doing drugs and alcohol, something good would happen. (Laughter) He felt as though this was a divine calling from heaven above to halt all his vices. Now can anyone tell me the three main vices of a 19-year-old college student? It's sex, alcohol and drugs. If you all didn't know that already. And after the first six months of him stopping his vices, I seen his whole life change completely. Again he thought this is a sign that maybe God doesn't want me to do drugs, drink alcohol or have sex. But no, that's not the case. Thank you. He was just simply learning discipline without knowing. Alright. I have a confession to make. Because I don't want to make this entire TED Talk about myself, I lied and said that this is a friend. (Laughter) It was actually me. (Laughter) (Applause) Now a cheat code to ensure that you're staying disciplined to whatever you're striving for is to prime your environment for success. Your habits are based on your habitat. And the main product of your habitat are the people in your life. Which brings me to a very important step of the Hi Level mindset. The fourth step, to be exact. Remove all negative people out of your life immediately. Anybody that's semidoubtful or naysaying, get them out. If you're talking about your dreams and goals and they give small, sarcastic remarks ... boot them. (Laughter) Just an all-around negative Nancy? Kick them out of there, man. Does anybody in the audience know somebody that's like that? Please raise your hand. I need you all to do me a favor. Pull your phones out and block them immediately. (Laughter) No, no, no. I'm dead serious. Don’t let someone else’s negativity cancel out your light, for it can temporarily get in the way of you achieving what's owed to you. You are a product of those who you hang around. Let's make sure we're hanging around other positive, Hi Level individuals. Now -- (Applause) Thank you. Now I like to consider myself a master at this Hi Level stuff. I mean, I am here for a reason, right? (Laughter) But that doesn't mean things always go my way. Even now, I just recently released my sophomore album ""From a Birds Eye View"" that I spent two full years creating. My debut album, ""The Lost Boy,"" was met with massive critical acclaim and success, and I had a lot of pressure on myself, to outdo myself. And in my eyes and in the eyes of many, I did. I had huge expectations for this album, but when it finally released and it wasn't received as well as I'd hoped, I completely broke down. I did my fasting. I stayed positive. I wrote down my dreams and goals. I was disciplined. I was doing this every day to make sure that this big moment that it was leading up to, that would change the entire world, would go perfectly. But that didn't happen. I did not meet the expectations that I had set for myself, that the world had set for me. And this is the first time as a major artist that I had received mixed reviews of my art. And again, it broke me down, man. I became unmotivated, I started overindulging in things that I'm not proud of. I was almost thinking about canceling my upcoming tour. I was in a very dark place. But then I heard this Yiddish proverb that A$AP Rocky actually told me about at a most important time, and I’m sure he didn’t even know it. It’s “We plan, and God laughs.” And that made me think. The Hi Level mindset is not a recipe for perfection but a commitment to honoring your potential and what you have to offer the world. Don't let your small failures make you lose sight of your bigger picture. I'll leave you all with this. We only have one life to live. 110 years maximum if you are a health guru and you have great health insurance. (Laughter) How are you going to maximize your time on this Earth? Do you want your name to be remembered long after you're gone? The Hi Level mindset is about doing everything that you put your hands on at the highest level that you're capable of doing. Think of your life as a book. Again, each chapter isn't going to be perfect. But how do you want your story to end? In anguish? A bunch of what-ifs? Or leaving a legacy? I choose legacy. The Hi Level way. Thank you. (Applause)"

It's not just enjoyable, it's also essential for your health and happiness, says science journalist Catherine Price. She proposes a new definition of fun -- what she calls ""true fun"" -- and shares easy, evidence-backed ways to weave playfulness, flow and connection into your everyday life.","science, health, psychology, happiness, motivation, personal growth",2022,"You know what's a lot harder than it seems like it should be? Actually feeling alive. And what I mean by that is that we are all constantly doing, or, at least, we're constantly scrolling. But we're not necessarily living. You know, we keep ourselves busy to the point of exhaustion, but we're also languishing. We feel a little bid dead inside. And I think we know that, on some level. I think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with. But we don't know what to do about it. So I'm here to tell you I figured out what to do about it. We need to have more fun. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) So you might think that you're already having plenty of fun, and that's because in our everyday speech, we often use the word ""fun"" to describe anything we do with our leisure time, even if it's not actually enjoyable, and, in fact, a waste of time. So for example, we scroll through social media ""for fun,"" even though doing so often makes us feel bad about, like, kind of everything. Or we'll say, ""That was so fun. We should do that again soon"" -- (Laughter) ... in response to things that weren't that fun and that we don't want to do again, ever. (Laughter) But it's not really our fault that we're a little bit sloppy about how we use the word ""fun,"" because even the dictionary doesn't get it quite right. It says that fun is amusement or enjoyment, or lighthearted pleasure. It's something for kids to have in play areas. It makes it sound like it's frivolous and optional. But if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you as having truly been fun -- and I really encourage you to do this -- the memories that you would describe as -- and forgive me for scientific terminology -- ""so fun"" -- you're going to notice there's something much deeper going on. I've collected thousands of these stories from people all around the world, and I can tell you it's amazing, because when people recount the memories in which they had the most fun, they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives. So in reality, fun is not just lighthearted pleasure. It's not just for kids, and it is definitely not frivolous. Instead, fun is the secret to feeling alive. So today, I want to propose to you a new, more precise definition of what fun is. I want to reveal some of the ways in which it is astonishingly good for us, and I want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience its power for yourself. So the first thing we need to start with is the fact that fun is a feeling, and it's not an activity. And that's important, because a lot of times, when I ask people what's fun, they'll respond with a list of activities that they enjoy. You know, they'll say, ""Dancing is fun,"" or ""Skiing is fun,"" or, I don't know, ""Pickleball is fun."" Everyone seems to think that pickleball is fun. (Cheers and laughter) And sure, pickleball can be fun, but we've all had experiences where something's off, and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun. And then on the flip side, we've had experiences where something that doesn't seem like it'll be fun at all ends up feeling ridiculously fun. There's an element of serendipity. But when people do have fun, when they experience this feeling, it's actually very easy to recognize, because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within. So, for example, here is me and my husband having fun together. Here are some presidents having fun together. (Laughter) Here’s Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama having fun together. (Cheers and laughter) Actually, those two seemed like they were very often, even constantly ... (Laughter) ... having fun together. (Laughter) And as you can see in these photographs, true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy. It's radiant. In fact, when I asked my daughter, when she was about five years old, what color fun would be, she said ""sunshine."" So what is this sunshine? You know? What is this feeling that we call ""fun""? When people tell me their stories about fun, it's really interesting, because the details are all different, and often quite mundane, but the energy running through them is the same. There were three factors that are consistently present, to the point that I believe they constitute a new definition, one that is a lot more accurate than what's in the dictionary. And those three factors are playfulness, connection and flow. So by playfulness, I do not mean you have to play games, or, God forbid, make believe. I just mean having a lighthearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not caring too much about the outcome. Letting go of perfectionism. When we have fun, our guard is down, and we're not taking ourselves too seriously. Connection refers to the feeling of having a special, shared experience. And I do think it's possible, in some circumstances, to have fun alone, and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings, or the activity. But in the majority of stories that people tell me about their peak fun memories, another person is involved. And that's true even for introverts. And then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time. You can think about an athlete in the middle of a game, or a musician playing a piece of music. It's when we're in the zone. It's possible to be in flow and not have fun, like if you're arguing, but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow. So playfulness, connection and flow all feel great on their own. But when we experience all three at once, something magical happens. We have fun. And that doesn't just feel good, it is good for us. In fact, fun does so many amazingly good things for us that I personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving, it's a cause. So, for example, fun is energizing. When people tell me their stories about fun, they glow. It is like a fire has been lit inside of them, and the energy and the warmth that they give off is contagious. You know, so much of life drains us, but fun fills us up. Fun also makes us present. A lot of us put a lot of work into trying to be more present -- we do yoga classes, we meditate, and that is all great, but the fact that fun is a flow state means that when we are having fun, we simply are present. There's no other way for it to happen. Fun also unites us. We live in a really polarized world, and as we all know, there's a lot of very serious problems. But when we have fun with people, we don't see them as different political parties, or nationalities or religions. We connect with them as human beings, and it's worth noting that that is the first step in being able to work together to solve those problems. Fun also makes us healthier. Being lonely and stressed out, as many of us have been for the past two years, causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease. But when we have fun, we're relaxed and we're more socially connected, both of which have the opposite effect. So, kind of blows my mind every time I think about it this way, but having fun is a health intervention. And then, lastly, fun is joyful. You know, we all so desperately want to be happy. We read books about happiness, we download apps about happiness, but when we are in a moment of having fun, we are happy. So it makes me think that, perhaps, the secret to long-term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun. So how do we do that? How do we have more fun? Well, to start with, do not take the suggestions you'll find in magazine articles about how to have more fun. I looked at some of these myself, and I found suggestions that include -- and I'm not making these up -- ""roast a turkey."" (Laughter) ""Put together an altar to loved ones who have passed."" (Laughter) “Watch a documentary about climate change.” (Laughter) And my personal favorite, ""Adorn your table with gourds."" (Laughter) Those are not good suggestions. Instead, the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on its ingredients, by which I mean, do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness, connection and flow. So here are some ideas for how to do so. To start with, reduce distractions in order to increase flow. Anything that distracts you is going to kick you out of flow and prevent you from having fun. And what's the number one source of distraction for most of us, these days? Oh, thank you. (Laughs) It was rhetorical, but yes, your phones. (Laughs) I wrote a book called ""How to Break Up With Your Phone,"" so I have strong feelings about this, but I can guarantee you that you are not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone. So today, I want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible, so you can take me up on my second suggestion, which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human beings in real life. Now, I know that one of the main reasons we're constantly on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life. (Laughter) So I want to assure you that it is worth it, and it is not as hard as it might seem. So here's how you do it. You start by making eye contact with someone. Like, look them in the eye, don't look in the middle of their forehead, where the camera would be on a Zoom call. (Laughter) And you say “Hello.” And if that goes well, you can introduce yourself. And if that goes well, maybe you can ask them a question, something that's thought-provoking, but not overly personal or threatening, like ""What's something that fascinates you?"" Or ""What's one thing that delighted you today?"" And you might be amazed by how good just one little moment of connection can make you feel. And if you do find someone to connect with, maybe ask them to join you in trying my third suggestion, which is to increase playfulness by finding opportunities to rebel. Now I am not talking about James Dean-level of rebellion. I'm talking about playful deviance. I'm talking about finding ways to break the rules of responsible adulthood, and giving yourself permission to get a kick out of your own life. One person told me that some of the most fun she'd had in recent memory, happened on a Friday morning, when she and some of her friends ditched their work and their childcare responsibilities, tucked flasks into their purses and snuck out to a 10:30am showing of the movie ""Bad Moms."" (Laughter) So lastly, here's one more thing that you can do today to start having more fun. [Roast a Turkey] I am just kidding. (Laughter) Prioritize it. That might sound totally obvious, but one of the main reasons we're not having enough fun is that we're not making it a priority. Our fun is always at the bottom of the list, and it can't speak up for itself. So I'm not suggesting that you take out your calendar and make an entry that says: “From 4 to 6pm on Saturday, I shall have fun.” That is a guaranteed way to not have fun. But if you know you consistently have fun when you spend time with a particular person, make a point to spend time with that person. If you know there's an activity that really does often generate playful connected flow for you, carve out time for it in your schedule. Treat fun as if it is important. Because it is. I've been doing this myself for a couple of years now, and it's amazing to see how many areas of my life fun has touched. I'm more creative and more productive, I'm more resilient. I laugh more. Making sure that I'm having enough fun has made me a better partner, a better parent and a better friend. And it has convinced me of something that I very much hope I can convince you of as well, which is that my daughter was right. Fun is sunshine. It's a distillation of life's energy. And the more often we experience it, the more we will feel like we're actually alive. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

In fact, a friend of mine you may have heard of -- Chris Rock -- he once called me the most late-blooming mofo he’d ever met. (Laughter) Now, some people might consider that snide, but I revel in it. I’m 55, and I’m here in this curvy body as someone who has done the work, lived the life walked the walk in these very high heels -- (Laughter) and therefore is qualified to testify in the church and in the court of law that it does, in fact, get greater later. (Applause and cheers) Now coming to this realization wasn’t easy. At the age of 38, I was a very successful fashion advertising executive, and I was really living what most people considered a dream life. I was jet-setting to fashion shows; I was receiving free designer clothes; I was double-kissing my way across the globe. (Laughter) I was. And, you know, it was everything that I ever wanted it to be, and then one day I realized I was only pretending to be happy. But I couldn’t blow up my good life in my prime earning years, right? Wrong. Which leads me to lessons my mother Lolly taught me. Lolly’s number one lesson: don’t settle. Don’t settle. Now I’m aware that my well-paying, glamorous career is not exactly the humdrum, “I hate my job” stereotype that most people equate with settling. But it was a settle for me, because when I actually did quit my job at the age of 38, it was with the intention that every day be a great adventure. Now sometimes it was a very scary adventure, like being broke from the age of 40 to 45. But even still, I wouldn’t trade that for the safe and settled version, because if I had, I would not be here with y’all today. (Applause and cheers) Yeah. So you know how when you like, buck the system and go against the status quo, it makes people really uncomfortable? And invariably, people will ask, “Where do you get your confidence?” (Laughter) Now some people mean it as a compliment, but very often it’s shady ... (Laughter) and it's a silent judgment. And to those people, I respond with a quote from this Brooklyn poet you may have heard of, Jay-Z. (Laughter) “She get it from her mama.” I am she, and my mama is the epitome of a grown-ass woman: someone who has always been very comfortable in her skin. In 1965, my mom was 37 years old. She already had one child, my big brother, Gerry, and she married my dad, but she kept her maiden name. And then she had my sister Stephanie and I back-to-back, but she continued to work because she refused to be beholden to my dad for money. And I bet my mom was the only woman in our neighborhood who cooked once a week. She made Sunday dinner. It was an extravaganza, but that’s all she did. She cooked one day a week. My mom is just amazing. And she also had this ability of talking to her children about real life and making sure that we understood the virtues of going your own way, which is why I believe today at the age of 94, and a recent widow, my mom is still carving out ways to find and determine and define her own version of happiness. She cooks for herself. She maintains her home exactly as she sees fit. She enjoys champagne and R-rated films. (Laughter) (Applause) My mom has managed to maintain her glamour, her sex appeal, you know, her independence. And I really hope some of that rubs off on me. You know, recently I’ve been thinking about one of the best lessons that my mom ever taught me, which is the literal beauty in aging. Now, we all know that Black don’t crack, right? OK... Black don’t crack. So at the age of 50, my mom could have easily passed for the age of 35. And you know, that’s back during the time when people -- women were really coy about their age. “Oh, a lady never tells her age.” My mom never subscribed to that. She was always proud of her age. As a matter of fact, she believes you may not tell your age, but your hands and your neck will. (Laughter) So make peace with aging, or prepare for an entire wardrobe of gloves and turtlenecks. (Laughter) Yeah, my mom has always done these wonderful things like that, but I wish she could rub off on everyone because I feel like now I’m looking at even 20-somethings who have a fear of aging. I watch them on social media, like, you know, compulsively practiclng the latest 10-second dance craze, and it feels like their angsty and asking, “Is that all there is?” And I just want to yell, “Yes, that is all there is if all you’re going to do is settle for dancing to someone else’s TikTok beat!” (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) Settling is very insidious. It keeps us dancing on this string, waiting for this elusive, better day to miraculously appear. Now thanks to Lolly’s tutelage, that’s not my story. In fact, I take each day as it comes but I try to make it better than the last. So, you know, I’m single ... but I’m always ready to mingle. (Laughter) I’m an entrepreneur, but I keep multiple revenue streams. I’m a solo traveler, which means I’ve done the sepia version of “Eat, Pray, Love” on six continents. Because I don’t settle. What that means is that I also don’t second-guess my decisions, and I’m also not worried about my future because I’m firmly rooted in the present. Settling is a really sinister thing. It will keep you up at night tossing and turning, trying to figure out why and trying to answer that age-old question of “Is that all there is?” Personally, I don’t have time for that, because the only time I want to be kept up all night long tossing and turning is when I’m in the company of a fine-ass man. (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) That's it. (Applause) I wish I could tell you guys that I learned all these valuable lessons from Lolly and they were instilled in me and it was great, but alas, I am a late bloomer in all regards. So I had to learn a couple of lessons from the era of Bitchy Bevy. What kind of person has 10 assistants in five years? Bitchy Bevy, that’s who. (Laughter) Now I didn’t start out my career with a toxic attitude. No, initially I was really happy to be in the fashion industry. You know, but then I began to compare my trajectory to others, and I also began to feel burned out because I was burdened by these personas that I had created that were allegedly going to help me progress in my career. I made a couple of mistakes. One, I thought that being snarky was a good career move. It wasn’t. I also thought I look good in the color brown. I actually don’t. (Laughter) Yeah. (Laughter) And, you know, I just -- in my dream montage, I wanted to get away from Bitchy Bevy. I wanted to get away from the color brown. And so in the movie version of my life, as soon as I quit my job, I’m a yoga guru. I’m extremely limber and very happy. Come to think of it though, guys, I’m actually limber and happy right now. But I would be lying -- and I believe it is against international law to lie during a TED Talk -- (Laughter) so I’m not going to do that. And as a matter of fact, my insecurities popped back up as late as last year. I was minding my business, as one does, perusing social media, and I saw people excelling in a space where I, you know, traditionally had a lot of success. So I’m looking at it and I’m like, “Well, why the hell they ain’t call me for that job?” And I have this, like, angst, and then I realize they didn’t call me for that job because you already said you didn’t want that job. You told the universe you weren’t into working like that. You don’t want a job -- I really don’t. (Laughter) I’m not into it. So... that’s why it happened. And what I realize is that intellectually I had grown and evolved, but emotionally ... I was Tom Petty and I was living in “Petticoat Junction.” (Laughter) I told y’all that brown doesn’t look good on me; petty looks even worse. It’s not my shade. And so what I wound up having to do was really get a grip. I had to assess a few things about myself, and I decided to do a little self-help ritual called ... “Take a note, give a note.” It’s easy. When you see someone having something that you believe you deserve, you take a note. You ask yourself a few questions. Is it something that you really want? Perhaps that person is better suited than you are for that. Does the universe -- is the universe conspiring for you to have that? Really kind of try and be honest with who you are and where you’re at in life. Once you do that, you take a deep breath -- (Inhales) and you say, “Their wins have nothing to do with my worthiness.” And then you’re ready to give a note. You go on social media, and you say congratulations. Or my personal favorite, you pick up the phone, like it’s the 20th century, and you say, “Congratulations, kudos, you did that, Al! You go, girl!” You do all the things. Instantly you feel like a better human being because you have actually extended grace. You’ve extended grace. You’ve extended grace to someone else. And I believe that when you remove malice from your heart, not only do you feel better, you look better. I think you lose your frown lines and your wrinkles lessen and your age spots disappear. I believe it’s better than Botox, extending grace. I do. (Applause) Yeah. No, but let me get back to the note thing. So one of my favorite notes is from Willie Shakespeare. “To thine own self be true.” Now we’ve all read self-help books, and the first line of defense is always “Be your most authentic self.” And I believe in that. I believe that nobody can be you but you, so you might as well show up and show out. But here’s the quandary that the bard never put forth. What if you don’t really know who you are because you suppressed your inner self? You’ve suppressed the core of you. You’ve suppressed the best parts of you because you took on these other identities and these personas in an effort to make your life better. Because, you know, we all buy into some things about what we’re supposed to be doing and who we’re supposed to be. So what if you squelch that? Because I know I had to excavate to dig up a Little Brown Bevy. But the way I found her was with three questions. Who am I at my core? How am I being perceived? How would I like to be perceived? Who am I at my core? At my core I’m looking to authentically connect with people. I don't like a cursory, you know, interaction, and I do not believe in networking. I like an authentic connection. I’m also curious and I’m adventurous and I’m kind and I’ve got big dreams. How am I being perceived? Well, y’all know the nickname, Bitchy Bevy ... so, duh. But here’s the problem. There’s a lot of power in that persona, and I actually really enjoyed it for a time, you know, because you can make a lot of money being a bitch, especially in fashion. (Laughter) But it’s also incredibly lonely and isolating, and I didn’t want to live that life anymore. And so I decided to change my life. And I left all of that alone. I really did, like, just change my spirit. And leaving fashion obviously helped. And when I did that, all of a sudden, I let Little Brown Bevy out to play. Little Brown Bevy. I love her so much. Little Brown Bevy is a nerdy girl, and so I let my nerdy pursuits come out to play. I must have joined every museum on Museum Mile in New York City. I began to travel the world just to look at architecture I had always dreamed of. I learned how to be alone without being lonely. My spirit shifted. I became a better person. You can ask people -- I became a better person. And now I get to stand here in front of you guys with no bravado, with nothing to prove, I tell you, with nothing to prove. I’m not trying to prove nothing to y’all. (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers and applause) Thank you. (Applause and cheers) I have an open heart. And I can’t even believe that Little Brown Bevy from 150th Street and Eighth Avenue, from the hamlet of Harlem, is now an award-winning radio and TV host, an author, an actress, a creative consultant. I would do all those things for free. But here’s the thing. I ain’t cheap, and I’m definitely not free, so don't get any ideas. (Laughter) (Applause) But I am here in this “Mama I made it” moment as someone who can show up as her most Bevyest self because I’ve done the work. Yeah, my most Bevyest self. So, you know, I’m going to show up -- some of you’ve met me -- you know I’m vibrant and boisterous, AKA loud. OK, you know that I’m going to show up, and I’ve got a pep in my high heel, red-bottom step. I do have heaving cleavage. (Laughter) And I’ve got a tell-it-like-it-is approach to life that’s always dosed with a ladle of love. It took me 55 years to get here. So, Chris Rock, you’re right. I’m a late bloomer. And that’s OK. Because I’m right on time, Because it gets greater later. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

In this forward-looking talk, he proposes a multi-specialty Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization (GERM) team that would detect potential outbreaks and stop them from becoming pandemics. By investing in disease monitoring, research and development as well as improved health systems, Gates believes we can ""create a world where everyone has a chance to live a healthy and productive life -- a life free from the fear of the next COVID-19.""","global issues, science, technology, disease, health, health care, future, history, humanity, pandemic, coronavirus",2022,"In the year 6 CE, a fire devastated Rome. In response, Emperor Augustus did something that had never been done before in the history of the Empire. He created a permanent team of firefighters who used buckets just like this one. Augustus understood that individuals alone can't protect themselves from fires. They need help from the community. When one person's house is on fire, that creates a risk for everyone else's homes. And so what we've had these last few years is like a horrific global fire. The COVID pandemic has killed millions and upended economies, and we want to stop that from happening again. COVID, it's hard to overstate how awful it's been. It's increased the health inequities between the rich and the poor. Survival depended partly on your income, your race, the neighborhood you lived in. And so we should seize this opportunity to create a world where everyone has a chance to live a healthy and productive life. Also a life free from the fear of the next COVID-19. When I was on this stage in 2015, I was one of many people who said we weren't ready and we needed to get ready. We didn't. The speech actually was watched by a lot of people. But 90 percent of the views were after it was too late. (Laughter) So now I hope the need is clear. And of course, we've learned a lot. During this pandemic, a lot of things worked well, a lot of things didn't work well. And so we have all that knowledge to build a prevention system. COVID-19 can be the last pandemic if we take the right steps. So how, what are these steps? Well, let's go back and look at what the Romans did. Think about how, over time, we've gotten good at preventing big fires. Fire prevention is kind of this pervasive thing. It's well funded. It's well understood. If an alarm went off right now, everyone here would know we're supposed to calmly gather, go out and wait instructions. We'd know that help would be on the way because we have lots of trained firefighters who practice. The United States alone has 370,000 full-time firefighters, even more than I guessed that number would be. We also have access to water. The United States, for example, has almost nine million fire hydrants. And so that type of investment, that type of practice, that type of system is what we need to stop pandemics. Now, often in movies, we'll have pandemics. And I'm always impressed with what takes place. Let's look at an example of this rapid response. [Motaba River Valley, Zaire] (Helicopter rotors whirring) Well, that's quite impressive. We don't need the music, but otherwise we saw exactly what should happen. An outbreak’s detected. Very quickly, literally within days, doctors are dispatched. They have a helicopter to get into exactly ground zero. They go in there, and they’ve got the right tools. And this is what should happen when an outbreak is spotted. But we don't have that team, we don't have those resources. And if an outbreak took place in a low-income country, it could be literally months before we started to orchestrate those resources. So despite what you see in movies, there is no group of experts standing by to prevent this disaster. So we have to create a new team. I believe we should create what I call the GERM team. Germ stands for Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization. This group is full-time. Their only priority is pandemic prevention. It's made up of a diverse set of specialists with a lot of different realms of expertise: epidemiologists, data scientists, logistics experts. And it's not just scientific and medical knowledge. They also have to have communication and diplomacy skills. The cost of this team is significant. It's over a billion a year to support the 3,000 people who would be on this team. And its mission is to stop outbreaks before they become pandemics. The work would be coordinated by the WHO. They'd be present in many locations around the world, stationed in public health agencies. They'd work closely with the national teams, depending on the income level. They'd have more in the lower-income countries. You know, for example, we could have GERM members say an epidemiologist, working out of the Africa CDC office in Abuja. And a very important thing is that like firefighters, a GERM team would do drills. When you want to have quick response, when you want to make sure you have all the pieces there and you can move very quickly, practice is key. That's how you make sure everyone knows what to do. Now, this team, there could be periods where there's no risky outbreak and they can keep their skills strong by working on some of the other infectious diseases, but that would be a second priority. They would work with countries to strengthen their health systems. The health systems are the front line. You need to know if, say, a lot of people show up with a new kind of cough, that’s when GERM needs to look into it and say, is this an outbreak? Is there a new pathogen here? What is the sequence of that? And so for all of this, the first 100 days are key. Viruses spread exponentially. And so if you get in there when the infection rate is fairly small, you can actually stop the spread. You know, in this epidemic, if we'd been able to stop it within 100 days, we would have saved over 98 percent of the lives. Now, we did have countries that did a good job. Australia is an example. They orchestrated diagnostic capacity. They came up with distancing policies and quarantine policies. And so their overall death rate per capita will be well less than a 10th of other countries. But we did not, as a world, contain it. And that's what we have to do next time. When COVID struck, we were almost like Rome before they had fire buckets and firefighters. We didn't have the people, the systems or the tools we need. Now, with the right investments, we can have a whole new generation of tools, better diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. A good example in the diagnostic area is this little machine, this is called the Lumira. We can have these all over the world that can test for any number of diseases. It’s a 10th as expensive as PCR, it’s absolutely as accurate, and it’s simple. So it can be used anywhere. We need other R&amp;D investments. One that I'm very excited about is the idea of a drug that you inhale that blocks you from getting infected. It can be pathogen-independent and trigger your immune system so that you'll be protected. A lot of the tools, the diagnostic tools and those infection-blocking tools are important because they can be staged in advance. Now, we also need vaccines, but we want to stop the outbreak before we have to do a global vaccination campaign. And so vaccines can play a couple of different roles, but not the primary role. We have to invest in more than just that. When we look at vaccines, they were the miracle of this epidemic. They saved millions of lives, but they can be far better. We need to invent easier-to-deliver vaccines that are just a patch you put on your arm or something that you inhale. We need vaccines that actually block infections. In this case, there were lots of breakthrough infections. We need vaccines that are broad spectrum, so they work against most of the emerging variants, which we did not have this time. And we also need factories that are standing by so we can build enough vaccines for the entire world within six months and achieve far better equity. The vaccines can also do something that would be super helpful, which is to help us eradicate entire families of viruses. Innovative new vaccines used properly could get rid of the flu family, the coronavirus family. And there's a huge burden of those, even in non-pandemic years, and if we get rid of it, it can never cause a pandemic. So I'm talking about investments in three broad areas: Disease monitoring, that's GERM. The R and D tools that are far better. And finally, and the most expensive, is improved health systems. This won't be cheap, but it'll save lives. And even it'll save money in the long run. It's like an insurance policy. The cost to prevent the next pandemic will be tens of billions of dollars. But let's compare that to what we just went through. The IMF estimates that COVID has cost nearly 14 trillion dollars. And so we need to spend billions in order to save trillions. And here's the best part of this. Even when we're not having an outbreak, these investments like the Lumira, those new vaccines, they will make people healthier. They'll shrink the gap, the health equity gap, which is gigantic, between rich and poor countries. For example, we can detect more HIV cases and do a better job of treatment. We can reduce deaths from malaria. We can get more people high-quality care. And so this is not just a downer about how to stop things from getting worse, but also a chance to make things better. If we take the right steps, we can make COVID-19 the last pandemic, and we can build a healthier, more equitable world for everyone. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Thank you so much. I have a few follow-up questions and one is really about the formal status of GERM. So you mentioned this would cost a billion dollars, you mentioned it comes through the WHO, but exactly who's running this, how does this work, how do we make this happen? BG: Well, GERM does not exist. It's a proposal I'm putting forward that hopefully over the next year, while the pain of the pandemic is still clear in people's minds, will get a global consensus. The rich-world governments will have to step up like they do with all the aid things and come up with that money. The way the personnel systems works, so that it's under WHO, but a really top-notch team, there will be a lot of debate about how to do that well. So, you know, I'm putting it forward and hopefully within the next year we'll get that consensus. HW: Who do you need to pick that up next? BG: Well, it's really the rich-world governments. The WHO has this big yearly meeting, the World Health Assembly, and at some point somebody will put forward a resolution and we'll see if the extra resources can be put in for that. After World War II, we did a lot. You know, we created the United Nations, we talked a lot about war. So I'd be stunned, although, you know, so far the action has been less than I would have expected, I'd be stunned if we don't go forward with something pretty close to what I'm laying out there. HW: This has been pretty personal for you. You know, the anti-vaxxers are out there, they are loud, and this has become personal. I just wanted to ask, like, how are you managing that? BG: Well, it's kind of weird. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, our foundation, the Gates Foundation, is very involved in vaccines, the invention of new vaccines, funding vaccines. And we're very proud that through joint efforts like GAVI, that saved tens of millions of lives. So it's somewhat ironic to have somebody turn around and say, no, you know, we're using vaccines to kill people or to make money or, you know, we started the pandemic, even some strange things like, that I somehow want to track, you know, the location of individuals because I'm so deeply desirous to know where everybody is. (Laughter) I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that information. (Laughter) You know, does this turn into something where, you know, there's constantly crazy people showing up? Who knows? But, you know, hopefully, as the pandemic calms down, people are more rational about, hey, vaccines are a miracle and there's a lot more we can do. HW: So the future is in our hands in the present. Bill Gates, thank you so much for being here. BG: Thank you. (Applause)"

Creator, actress and author Lilly Singh thinks we need to build a better table. In this hilarious, incisive talk, Singh traces the arc of her career from up-and-coming YouTuber to history-making late-night talk show host, offering four ways to build a more inclusive society where girls are encouraged and empowered to do great things.","culture, social change, gender, women, equality",2022,"So when I was born on September 26, 1988, my grandparents and great grandparents back in India didn't find out for two weeks, which is a shame because I mean, look how perfect I was. (Laughter) And it's not because the phone lines were down or because they weren't available. It's because there was a complication with my birth. And that complication was being assigned female at birth. You see, because my mom had been told that if she gave birth to a daughter, it wasn't worth phoning home about. After all, she’d already given birth to my older sister, and this time everyone had high hopes that she would do right and have a son. But she didn't. She had me. And so there were no congratulations or Indian sweets sent our way. Just the reality that from the moment I came into this world, I was already a disappointment to so many people. It's as if they had a time machine and already knew the trajectory of my entire career and life and decided that I had less to offer. And it sucked. So why am I telling you this heavy story? I'm supposed to be a funny person. I have the nerve to come out here and hit you right in the feels. How dare I? I'm telling you this because although this is my lived experience, it's also the reality that millions of girls face every day across every culture and in every country. And I'm telling you this because being born into this reality set me on a lifetime mission of trying to prove myself and just feel like I was enough. What did I want to be when I grow up? I wanted to be treated equally. And I'm not alone in this mission. In fact, us girls, what we desperately want is a seat at the table. It's what every motivational poster, Tumblr post, Instagram account you follow, business card tells us: Success is a seat at the table. And if they want to be extra spicy, they say, ""If there is no seat, drag your own seat."" I'm sure you've heard this, right? And so my marching orders were clear. Get a seat at this coveted table by any means necessary. And that's been the driving force behind my entire career. Now, in 2010, I noticed that no one on YouTube looked like me. There was no South Asian woman who's very loud and uses her hands a lot, giving her take on the world. There was no me in front of a camera. I saw a seat up for grabs. So I got to work, and I started a channel under the name “Superwoman.” Yeah, because although I’m smart enough to do a TED Talk, I'm not smart enough to understand copyright. (Laughter) I taught myself how to write, shoot and edit my own content. And I worked really hard. When I finally got the hang of it, I committed to posting two comedy videos a week. And I found success. With a backwards snapback on my head, I gave my take on relationships, pop culture, taboo subjects and, most popularly, dressed up like my parents. (Laughter) I can't tell you how many times I forgot to wipe that chest hair off. A lot of times. (Laughter) Now fast forward to 2015, and I'm on stage in India announcing my first world tour. As fate would have it, the day after this monumental milestone, I was set to fly to Punjab, India to visit my grandfather for the first time in my adult life. And whoo, nothing could have prepared me for what was about to happen. I vividly remember it. I was in the car driving to his house. He was standing outside. I nervously got out of the car, walked up to him. He walked up to me, looked me right in the eyes, and he raised his hand and decorated me with a flower garland: a gesture fit for people of importance. He then proceeded to welcome me into his home, my mom by my side, and proceed to show me all the newspaper clippings he had saved with my name and face on them. He said the words he was wrong. Words I had never heard a man say before to me. He said that I had done what no one else could have done, and I had made the family name proud. Me, Lilly, the baby born a girl. That's right. Now in that moment I truly felt like Superwoman. I did. You know, through my YouTube videos, I've amassed almost 15 million subscribers and three billion views. But more important than all of that, I managed to change one view. I challenged my grandfather's entrenched gender beliefs. And for the first time in my life, I remember thinking in that moment, “Oh, I finally got a seat at the table ...” Hello, props. (Laughter) "" ... alongside the men in the industry.” I felt like that. And encouraged by my grandfather's approval, I became more confident in my influence. I remember thinking, ""Oh, I'm going to talk at this table, I'm going to join the dinner conversation."" You know, a lot of my male mentors make comments and posts about box office numbers and salaries and titles and those dollar dollar bills. So I thought, I'm going to chime in here. I learned very quickly that whenever I spoke of money, people got a little uncomfortable. Like the time I pointed out the gender gap in the Forbes list for online creators, a list I'd previously been on. I remember wanting to start a critical conversation because I saw this article and I was heartbroken. You know, the digital space had always been a place that I thought was without gatekeepers. And here it was looking just like old Hollywood. Well, let me tell you, the internet was not interested. I don't know how it's possible, but it literally felt as if Twitter leaped through my screen and body slammed me onto my desk. The message was clear: you can be on this list, but don't try to start any conversations about the inequality on this list. I have thousands and thousands of videos. One of my most disliked videos is why I’m not in a relationship. Yeah. A lot of the men at the table did not like me telling them why I didn't need a boyfriend. I quickly learned that there’s an invisible gatekeeper called culture, and the table is smack dab in the middle of it. Now, in 2019, I made history with my late-night show, “A Little Late with Lilly Singh.” Thank you, thank you. (Applause) There I was, Lilly, the baby born a brown girl, rubbing elbows, or at least time slots, with comedy royalty. And I got to give a huge shout out to NBC for boldly trying to break late-night tradition. I remember when the show came out, I remember all the articles because they looked practically identical. ""Bisexual Woman of Color Gets Late-Night Show."" I almost legally changed my name to ""bisexual woman of color"" because that's what people called me so often. And you know, as strange as that sentiment was, I thought, OK, the silver lining is that we'll finally get a different perspective in late-night. A little bit of melanin, a dash of queer, a different take on things. Let's do this! And I remember thinking, ""Now, oh, now I've been invited to the big table. And now things will be different."" So I took my seat. Now, unfortunately, the budget wasn't based on the importance or significance or historic nature of the show. It was based on the 1:30am time-slot that we had. So to say the budget was small, the writing staff even smaller, and to do the first season, I had to shoot 96 episodes of late-night television in three months. Audience: Whoo. LS: Whoo is right. To put that into perspective, that is shooting two to three episodes a day versus the network standard of one a day, maybe two on Thursday. We did it all with a writing staff of about half a dozen writers versus the network standard that's about double that. Words cannot explain to you how exhausting, emotionally and spiritually challenging that was. And I started to feel like, ""Hm, I think this chair's a little wobbly."" Now, I think we can all agree that the beauty and magic of late-night is its timeliness. You know that no matter what's happening in the world, you can turn on late-night television and hear all about it. But when you shoot 96 episodes in three months, you kind of lose that magic. I was the only show talking about hooking up, partying, cuddling, traveling, in front of a live audience during a literal global pandemic. Now, still, I thought, if the budget doesn't celebrate the historicness of the show, then the creative can. I can bring some much needed spice to late-night. And sometimes I was successful. But other times, I would receive notes like, ""Don't be so loud."" ""Don't be so big."" ""Don't be so angry, smile more."" And my all time favorite, ""Don't overindex on the South Asian stuff."" After all, everyone else at the table who's been sitting there for years, people are used to them. I might be a little jarring to audiences. Now, during season two of my show, I remember I went into overdrive. I found all the loopholes, I did all the necessary jobs to try to make the show more timely. And I was excited to. And I felt compelled to because for the first time in history, we had a woman, not to mention half South Asian woman, become vice president of the United States. Now we witnessed one of the greatest protests in human history with the farmer protests in India. And I was excited to finally give my take on these things. But my take was almost never included in topical media news coverage round-ups. You know, we still got the same voices, the same perspectives, even though someone and something different was literally in the next time slot. I kept trying to pull up my seat. I kept trying to join the dinner conversation. I kept trying to ask for a more supportive seat. But every time I would be told that I should be grateful to have a seat in the first place. After all, everyone else that looks like me is still waiting outside the restaurant in the cold. You know, the strange thing about having a wobbly seat is that you spend so much time trying to keep it upright that you can never bring your full self to the table. So now, why am I telling you all this? Well, because my therapist costs 200 dollars an hour and this is way cheaper. (Laughter) But also because I just experienced one of the most notorious boys' clubs ever in late-night television. And I'm here to offer solutions. I don't always follow up a venting session with solutions, but when I do, it’s a TED Talk. (Laughter) That's right. (Applause) You see, my goal was always a seat at the table. It's what women are conditioned to believe success is. And when the chair doesn't fit, when it doesn't reach the table, when it's wobbly, when it's full of splinters, we don't have the luxury of fixing it or finding another one. But we try anyways. We take on that responsibility, and we shoulder that burden. Now, I've been fortunate enough to sit at a few seats, at a few different tables. And what I've learned is, when you get the seat, trying to fix the seat won't fix the problem. Why? Because the table was never built for us in the first place. The solution? Build better tables. (Applause) So, allow me to be your very own IKEA manual. I would like to present to you a set of guidelines I very eloquently call: “How to Build a Table that Doesn’t Suck”. (Laughter) I've been told I'm very literal. Now, right off the bat, let me tell you, this assembly is going to take more than one person or group of people. It's going to take everyone. Are you ready? Should we dive in? Let's do it. Up first, don't weaponize gratitude. Now, don't get me wrong, gratitude is a great word. It's nice, it's fluffy, a solid 11 points in Scrabble. However, let's be clear. Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy, it's not a form of currency. Women are assigned 10 percent more work and spend more time on unrewarded, unrecognized and non-promotable tasks. Basically, what this means is all the things men don't want to do are being handed to women, and a lot of those things largely include things that advance inclusivity, equity and diversity in the workplace. So hear me when I say, a woman shouldn't be grateful to sit at a table. She should be paid to sit at a table. (Applause) Especially ones she largely helped build. And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened if she doesn't seem ""grateful"" enough. In other words, corporations, this step involves a woman doing a job and being paid in money, opportunity and promotion, not just gratitude. And women -- yeah, go ahead, live it up, live your life. (Applause) And women, a moment of real talk, trust me, I've been there and I know it's so tough, but we have to understand and remember that being grateful and being treated fairly are not mutually exclusive. I can be grateful but still know exactly what I deserve. And that's the way to do it. (Applause) Up next, invest in potential. When investing in women, don’t invest in the 1:30am time slot. Invest in empowering something different. Invest in a new voice. Give them the support they actually need. Cultural change takes time and money. Heck, it took my grandfather 25 years to see that I was worthy of more. So a true investment is one that values potential over proof. Because so often that proof doesn't exist for women. Not because we aren't qualified, but because we haven't been given the opportunity. In other words, if you're trying to be inclusive, don't give someone new a seat made of straw until they prove they deserve a better one. Don't hold something called a ""prove it again"" bias, which requires less privileged people to constantly keep proving themselves, even though white men tend to get by on just their potential. Give them a seat that they can thrive in, that they can do the job you hired them to do in. Allow them to contribute to the table, and they will make it better. Up next, this is my favorite one. My favorite one, it's quite common sense, actually. Make space for us. You know, for every three men at a table, there's only one place setting for a woman. People are so used to more men showing up that they plan for it. There's an extra seat in the corner, there's a steak under the heat lamp. When more men show up, the table gets longer. But when that extra RSVP is a woman, more often than not she's encouraged to compete against the only other woman that was invited to the table. Instead, we need to build multiple seats for multiple women, not just one or two, so that women are not sitting on top of each other's laps, fighting for one meal. We already know that more diverse teams perform better. A recent study shows that corporations that have more gender diversity on their executive teams, were 25 percent more likely to experience above average profitability. And more racially diverse companies had 36 percent more profit. So really, no matter how you look at it, it's time to build longer tables and more seats. And I want to say something, and I want to admit something, I want to be vulnerable for a second. Because I've fallen victim to this so many times, and women, let me know if you've experienced this. We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset and champion each other, you know, because I've learned what's the better win? Me sitting at a table or us sitting at a table? Don't be convinced to fight for one spot. Instead fight for multiple spots. (Applause) And let me lead by example right now and say, I know there’s many other women that are going to come on this stage, and I hope they all nail it, and I will be cheering you all on because we can all win. And I'm going to be your biggest cheerleader when you're up here. (Applause) Last, it's time to upgrade the table talk. Now, I believe stories make the world go around. You thought it had something to do the solar system? Joke's on you, it's stories. (Laughs) Stories are how we understand ourselves, how we understand others and how we understand the world. And arguably the most important stories are those we see in the media. Because we’ve seen time and time that they control the narrative and impact culture. Now, when it comes to genre, you can argue that certain genres have certain target demographics. When it comes to the world news, the target demographic is the world, and we know half of the world is female. Yet women and girls make up only a quarter of the people interviewed or that the news is even about in the first place. Instead, when it comes to issues that impact women, we not only need to be included in the coverage, we need to be driving those stories and dimensionalizing our own experience. Inviting everyone in on the table talk isn't just a nice gesture. It makes for better, more productive, smarter conversation with more than one point of view. And that's how you get better. So this all sounds like a lot of work. And it is. But I'm going to tell you why it's necessary and worth it. To be honest, this is about so much more than just women in the workplace. In fact, I could probably come up with many more guidelines across many other industries. This is about creating a world where half of the population can thrive. You see, because the work we do today can create a world where future generations of girls can have equitable access and opportunity. And here's the best part. Are you ready for it? Everyone listening today, all the men, the women, everyone in between, the big companies, the small ones, the media outlets, the people that snuck into the back, all of you, you can help create this future. A future where we have longer tables and more seats that actually work instead of fighting for a seat at the old ones that don't. A future where everyone is seated at the table equally. And a future where being assigned female at birth is not a disappointment or a disadvantage, because girls are encouraged, empowered and expected to do great things. And I can't wait to make that a reality. Thank you so much. (Applause and cheers)"

A two-time NCAA champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time WNBA champion, Parker knows what it takes to fight for your dreams. In this inspiring talk, she shares what she's learned during a career spent not accepting limits -- and how her daughter taught her the best lesson of all. ""Barrier breaking is about not staying in your lane and not being something that the world expects you to be,"" she says. ""It's about not accepting limitations.""","social change, activism, sports, motivation, personal growth, equality",2022,"You know, everywhere in the world, the question inevitably comes up: ""Do you play basketball?"" (Laughter) From the neighbor across the street -- ""Hey, do you hoop?"" -- to the five-foot-seven guy at TSA PreCheck -- (Laughter) that swore that he could beat me one on one. (Laughter) I despise fitting into the lane or the mold that this question insinuates. But I reluctantly say, “Yes.” I am a two-time NCAA champion. (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you. A two-time gold medalist and a two-time -- (Applause) A two-time WNBA champion. (Cheers) But inside I scream, ""I am so much more."" (Applause) You see, barrier breaking is about not staying in your lane and not being something that the world expects you to be. It's about not accepting limitations. It starts with inspiration, and it's a foundation built upon picking apart what everybody thinks is the right way to do things. There are so many barrier breakers in here that are fighting so hard to unlock doors that they may never walk through, but they do it anyway because we're standing on the shoulders of those that did it for us. It's an uphill battle, and it doesn't guarantee big wins or lots of success. And throughout that uphill battle, I think all of us look for hope, right? We all look for optimism. And mine is my daughter and this next generation. You see, I get to be the mom to an amazing 12-year-old daughter. Yes, I know. I am partial. (Laughter) But she's pretty dope. I've been fortunate enough to travel the world with her while she allows her mom to fight for her dreams. We've played in Russia, and I say we because she really does think she's part of the team. (Laughter) We played in Russia, Turkey, China. And throughout that journey, I thought I would be the one teaching her, challenging her, being the example for her. But I’ve realized it’s a two-way street. You see, at three years old, I decided to enroll her in school in Russia. I was like, I wanted her to have a normal life, right? I want her to be able to meet kids her age. So at three, she befriended this little girl. Her name was Masha. Masha didn't speak any English. Lailaa barely spoke Russian, but her parents invited us over to their house. And so we went. We went for this playdate. So we knock on the door, and Masha's parents open the door so graciously and welcome us into their home. And we step forward, and I realize there’s no floor. It's a modest home. It's one room with a couch on the side that pulls out into the bed that they sleep on. There's a wood fire oven in the middle that heats the room and that they cook with. And at three years old, I was concerned. So I go to grab Lailaa, but I was too late. She looked in the corner and she said, “A dollhouse!” And Masha and Lailaa ran to the corner to play with the dollhouse. I'm so proud that that's my kid, and I can't say that I had much to do with that. She has a way of like uniting people, finding commonality, of rolling with the punches, of making the best of situations. I’ve always wanted to uplift her, because the messaging that I received from home was never shrink yourself to fit into this world, that you're enough, that everyone is enough, but you need to be individually you all the time. I was fortunate to grow up in an environment with my parents and my two brothers who empowered me every single day. They told me I can do anything I set my mind to, so much so that my nickname was “Can Do.” (Laughter) And it was later extended by my brothers to “Can Do Anything And Get Away With It.” (Laughter) I was the baby of the family. Yes, I was the baby, and I didn't lack confidence. If I wasn't kicking the ball out of the recess school parking lot in a dress, to my moms despise, or high, high in the trees. I loved to compete. At everything, not just in sports, either. This one time my teacher in elementary school, he said, ""I want to know who can learn the helping verb song the fastest. (Sings) (Laughter) I love to compete. I was that kid. I was that kid. (Applause) But what I loved so much was that I was allowed to be me. I was allowed to compete. I was allowed to speak my mind. My parents encouraged that. Just because you're a girl, you don't have to stay in a certain lane. And then something happened in 1997. The women’s professional basketball league started. The WNBA had its inaugural season when I was 11 years old, and I saw people that looked like me playing the game that I loved so much. I no longer had to go out in the driveway and try to dunk like Michael Jordan. I could go out and get buckets like Cynthia Cooper. (Applause) You see, my parents encouraged sports because sports in their eyes was a microcosm of life. You learn to win. You learn to lose. You learn to work through obstacles. You learn to get up when you don't want to. You learn to value differences, because those are important. But as I ventured out into the world, I realized, like, the world wasn't so uplifting towards differences, right? The world had a way of ... putting differences in a box. For instance, I received my girls basketball uniform in middle school. It was old and smelly and tight. The boys got brand new ones. My brother worked his butt off to get into one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country. My family was so proud. We heard the whispers: they said, “Quotas.” The world had a way of just putting differences in a box and then getting mad when we had the audacity to not fit. Just as an individual, you get mad at me for not fitting in the box that you made. There was a time that went by where ... I didn't want to say yes to the basketball question. Because if I checked that box, then I checked all of their other assumptions, right? So competitive juices kicked in. I'll show you, I'll show you. I'm going to be the best. Girls can't dunk in a game? I'll dunk twice. (Applause) You can't hold up an MVP trophy pregnant? OK, I'll show you. You can't have a family, a career and nurse your daughter. I came back nine weeks post-delivery and I played in a game, and I nursed my daughter for 13 months. (Applause) You can't be on the cover of a video game. You can’t do a TED Talk as an athlete. (Cheers) (Applause) But this entire time, my idea of breaking barriers was being something so that the world could see that it was possible. But breaking down barriers isn't always records. In [2021], like most of you, I sat around the television because I knew this was a moment. I sat my daughter front and center. I said, ""Lailaa, watch this."" The first African-American Asian Vice President was being sworn in. This is a moment that you might not appreciate now. (Applause) But in time you will. And as Kamala Harris was being sworn in, I said, “Lailaa, now look at her. Now you can do that too.” And Lailaa looked at me. She looked through my eyes, and she said, “Why couldn’t I before?” (Laughter) (Applause) Suddenly, I felt this big because I had become what I despised the most in this world. I had put her in a box because you see, the story that the world told me was women aren’t Vice Presidents. And I had assumed that that's what they had told my daughter. I'm telling you, Generation Z, my daughter's generation, they're changing the world, they're changing the world through conversation, through unity and through living as though boxes and barriers don't exist. It's no longer enough to just put your head down. Get the job. Accomplish the feat. We have to unite, to come together, to figure out why barriers are there in the first place. And Generation Z is doing that. They're listening. They're seeing both sides. And they're uniting for causes that don't directly impact them. We have entire sports leagues that are standing up for what they believe in. It's no longer just one athlete. We have men that are fighting for women to receive equal pay. We have white allies that are protesting racial inequalities. We are talking about mental health. And you know what's so special? My daughter the other week came up and handed me a list of stores that we're not allowed to shop at anymore. (Laughter) I’m like, “Lailaa, like, another lesson, like, already?” She's like, ""Mom, we're not allowed to shop at these stores because they're not body positive and body conscious towards all shapes and sizes.” (Applause) And you know what, I'm listening, I'll be honest, and I'm learning, and you should, too, because my optimism lies in the next. That they will take our obstacles, our struggles, our insecurities, our challenges and not see them as obstacles, but as opportunities. Or they may not even acknowledge them at all. I'm proud because Generation Z are proud, bold, and they're themselves. Because those ... that were told that they can't their entire life are having kids that are making us believe that we can. So go ahead, ask me if I play basketball, and I’ll proudly say, “Yes.” Because I realize I was the one putting basketball in a box all along. Thank you so much for this opportunity. (Cheers) (Applause)"

In a talk full of beautiful storytelling, he explains the profound impact of something he calls the ""illusion of continuity"" -- the belief that our future selves will share the same views, perspectives and hopes as our current selves -- and shows how we can more proactively craft the people we are to become.","psychology, storytelling, motivation, personal growth, self, personality",2022,"When I was 12 years old, I fractured my foot playing soccer. I didn't tell my parents when I got home that night, because the next day, my dad was taking me to see a movie, a soccer movie. I worried that if I told my parents about the foot, they would take me to see a doctor. I didn't want to see a doctor, I wanted to see the movie. The next morning, my dad goes, ""It's nice out. Why don't we walk to the theater."" (Laughter) It was a mile away. As we go, he says, ""Why are you limping?"" I tell him I have something in my shoe. The movie was spectacular. It told the story of some of soccer's greatest stars, great Brazilian players. I was ecstatic. At the end of the movie, I told my dad about the foot; he took me to see an orthopedic doctor, who put my foot in a cast for three weeks. I tell you the story today, because four decades later, I don't really consider myself a soccer fan anymore. Today, my sports fandom is tuned to another kind of football. Now my 12-year-old self wouldn't just find this incomprehensible. My 12-year-old self would see this as a betrayal. Now you might say we all change from the time we are 12, so let me fast-forward a decade. When I was 22, I was a freshly minted electronics engineer in southern India. I had no idea that three decades later, I would be living in the United States, that I would be a journalist, and that I would be the host of a podcast called ""Hidden Brain."" It's a show about human behavior and how to apply psychological science to our lives. Now we didn’t have podcasts when I graduated from college. We didn’t walk around with smartphones in our pockets. So my future was not just unknown; it was unknowable. All of us have seen what this is like in the last three years, as we slowly try and emerge from the COVID pandemic. If we think about the people we used to be three years ago, before the pandemic, we can see how we have changed. We can see how anxiety and isolation and upheavals in our lives and livelihoods, how this has changed us, changed our outlook, changed our perspective. But there is a paradox here, and the paradox is when we look backwards, we can see enormous changes in who we have become. But when we look forwards, we tend to imagine that we're going to be the same people in the future. Now sure, we imagine the world is going to be different. We know what AI and climate change is going to mean for a very different world. But we don't imagine that we ourselves will have different perspectives, different views, different preferences in the future. I call this the illusion of continuity. And I think one reason this happens is that when we look backwards, the contrast with our prior selves to who we are today is so clear. We can see it so clearly that we have become different people. When we look forward, we can imagine ourselves being a little older, a little grayer, but we don't imagine, fundamentally, that we're going to have a different outlook or perspective, that we're going to be different people. And so those changes seem more amorphous. I want to make the case to you today that this illusion has profound consequences not just for whether we become soccer players or podcast hosts, but for matters involving life and death. Let me introduce you to John and Stephanie Rinka. We did a story about them for ""Hidden Brain"" some years ago. This photograph was taken in 1971, on their wedding day. John and Stephanie had just eloped, and gotten married at Cambridge City Hall in Massachusetts. He was 22, she was 19. John told me that after they got married, they traveled to different parts of the country. They eventually settled in North Carolina. John became a high school basketball coach, Stephanie became a nurse. And because they lived in a rural part of the state, she would often make house visits to patients. Many of the patients she saw were very sick. They had terminal illnesses, very low quality of life. And when Stephanie came home from these visits, she was often shaken. And she would tell John, ""John, if I ever get a terminal illness, please do nothing to prolong my suffering. I care more about quality of life than quantity of life. In her more dramatic moments, she would say, ""John, if I ever get that sick, just shoot me. Just shoot me."" And John Rinka would look lovingly at his wife, his healthy wife, and he would say, ""OK, Steph. OK."" Fast-forward a couple of decades. In her late fifties, Stephanie begins to slur her words. She goes to see a doctor, who runs some tests, and he diagnoses her with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. He tells her it's fatal. It's incurable. And he tells her that a day is going to come when she is no longer able to breathe on her own. Stephanie, being Stephanie, decides to extract as much joy and pleasure from life as she can, she spends time with friends and family. As she gets sicker, she and John spend some time on a beautiful beach that they both love. But there comes a day when Stephanie, in fact, is no longer able to breathe. She's gasping for air, and John takes her to the hospital. And a nurse at the hospital asked Stephanie, ""Mrs. Rinka, would you like us to put you on a ventilator?"" And Stephanie says yes. John is flabbergasted. They've been having this conversation for 30 years. Surely that's not what Stephanie wants. He doesn't say anything. The next morning, he says, ""Steph, when the nurse asked you yesterday if you wanted to go on a ventilator, and you said yes, is that really what you want?"" And Stephanie Rinka said yes. Now, you might argue that if Stephanie had written out an advance directive, if Stephanie had come into the hospital unconscious, if the nurse had asked John, ""What is it your wife would want?"" John, without hesitation, would have said, ""Of course she does not want to go on a ventilator. We should figure out a way to keep her as comfortable as possible so that she can die with dignity."" But of course, this only solves the legal conundrum. It doesn't solve the ethical problem here. And the ethical problem is that Stephanie, at age 39, as she was healthy, had no real conception of what Stephanie at age 59, with a terminal illness, gasping for air, would really want. For the older Stephanie, her younger self might as well have been a stranger. A stranger who was trying to make life and death decisions for her. Philosophers have talked for many years about a thought experiment; it’s sometimes called the “ship of Theseus”. The great warrior Theseus returned from his exploits, his ship was stationed in the harbor as a memorial. And over the decades, parts of the ship began to rot and decay, and as this happened, planks were replaced by new planks. Until, eventually, every part of the ship of Theseus was built from something new. And philosophers, starting with Plato, have asked the question ""If every part of the ship of Theseus is new, is this still the ship of Theseus?"" You and I are walking examples of the ship of Theseus. Our cells turn over all the time. The people you were 10 years ago are not the people you are today. Biologically, you have become a different person. But I believe something much more profound happens at a psychological level. Because you could argue a ship is not just a collection of planks, a body is not just a collection of cells. It's the organization of the planks that makes the ship. It's the organization of the cells that make the body. If you preserve the organization, even if you swap planks or cells in and out, you still have the ship, you still have the same body. But at a psychological level, each new layer that's put down is not identical to the one that came before it. The famous plasticity of the brain that we've all heard so much about means that, on an ongoing basis, you are constantly becoming a new person. This has profound consequences for so many aspects of our lives. You know, I have the illusion that 12-year-old Shankar who wanted to be a soccer star, and 52-year-old Shankar who is the podcast host and 82-year-old Shankar, who will hopefully be living one day on a beautiful beach, that these are all the same person. Is that really true? Let's set aside the philosophical questions for another day, and let me tell you about some of the practical challenges of this problem. When we make promises to other people, when we promise to love someone till death do us part, we are making a promise that a stranger is going to have to keep. Our future selves might not share our views, our perspectives, our hopes. When we lock people up and throw away the key, it's not just that the people we imprison are going to be different in 30 years. We are going to be different 30 years from now. Our need for retribution, for vengeance, might not be what it is today. (Applause) When we pass laws, we often do so with an intent of making a better country, improving our country. But any country that's been around for a few decades has numerous laws on the books that made perfect sense when they were crafted -- in fact, that were seen as enlightened when they were crafted -- and today, they seem antiquated or absurd, or even unconscionable. And all of these examples stem from the same problem, which is that we imagine that we represent the end of history. That the future is only going to be more of the same. I have three pieces of advice on how to wrestle with this wicked problem. And it is a wicked problem, because all of us spend so much of our lives trying to make our future selves happy. We don't stop to ask, ""Is it possible that in 20 or 30 years, our future selves are going to look back at us with bewilderment, with resentment. That our future selves will ask us, ""What made you possibly think that that is what I would want?"" The first piece of advice I have is if you accept the idea that you're going to be a different person in 30 years' time, you should play an active role crafting the person you are going to become. You should be the curator of your future self. You should be the architect of your future self. But what does that mean? Spend time with people who are not just your friends and family. Spend time on avocations and professional pursuits that are not just what you do regularly. Expand your horizons, because you're going to become someone different, you might as well be in charge of deciding who that person is going to be. So the first piece of advice is to stay curious. Second, as we make pronouncements on social media or in political forums, or at dinner parties, let's bear in mind that among the people who might disagree with us are our own future selves. (Laughter) So when we express views with great certitude and confidence, let's remember to add a touch of humility. This is true, by the way, not just at an individual level -- it's also true at an organizational level. I was speaking, some time ago, with this young, wonderful woman. She had just reached a position of authority at her organization, and she had many idealistic ideas of how she wanted to change her organization. And she asked me, ""How do we make these changes so that in the future, no one's going to come along and undo the changes that I have made?"" And it's a very human impulse, but it stems from the same belief, that our perspective on history is the final word. And quite simply, this is wrong. Three. I've given you a number of ways in which our future selves are going to be weaker and frailer than we are today. And that is true, that is part of the story. But it is only a part of the story. Our future selves are also going to have capacities and strengths and wisdom that we do not possess today. So when we confront opportunities and we hesitate, when I tell myself, ""I don't think I have it in me to quit my job and start my own company,"" or I tell myself I don't have it in me to learn a musical instrument at the age of 52. Or I tell myself I don't have it in me to look after a disabled child. What we really should be saying is ""I don't have the capacity to do those things today. That doesn’t mean I won’t have the capacity to do those things tomorrow.” So lesson number three is to be brave. I believe if you can do these three things, if you can stay curious, you can practice humility and you can be brave, then your future self will look back at you in 20 or 30 years -- will look back, not with resentment or bewilderment, but will look back at you and say: ""Thank you."" (Applause)"

RNA researcher Melissa J. Moore -- Moderna's chief scientific officer and one of the many people responsible for the rapid creation and deployment of their COVID-19 vaccine -- takes us down to the molecular level, unraveling how mRNA helps our bodies' proteins maintain health, prevent disease and correct errors in our genetic code. ""We have entered an entirely new era of medicine,"" Moore says.","science, innovation, health, cancer, medicine, humanity, public health, Vaccines, medical research, pandemic, heart",2022,"Now, many of the people watching this talk by now will have had one, two, three or even four doses of a messenger RNA vaccine. With billions of these shots now in arms. it’s clear that this new way of making vaccines is both remarkably safe and incredibly effective. But did you know it's not the vaccine itself that's keeping you safe? It's actually you. Because the human body has amazing powers to both prevent and cure disease by making its own medicines. You just need to know what medicine to make. And that's what your vaccine gave you. Simply a set of instructions for how to protect yourself against SARS-CoV-2. Now vaccines are only the beginning. As I said before, the advent of mRNA vaccines is heralding in an entirely new era of medicines. mRNAs give us the ability to not only prevent disease but also treat previously intractable disorders. But before I get to that, let's talk about what is this new way of medicines really about? Well, it all comes down to proteins. Now, you may think of protein as simply something that you need to eat, an important part of your diet, something that's important for you to build muscle. But it's not just muscle that contains protein. Protein makes up a huge fraction of the incredibly complicated ecosystem that's your entire body. In many ways, your body functions like a large city, full of myriad buildings, interconnected buildings, with lots of different structures. Now, just as the word ""building"" fails to capture the incredible variety of structures that make up any large city, the generic term ""protein"" gives no clue as to the incredible variety of molecular architectures at the molecular level. Like buildings, proteins are not monolithic. Our body makes many proteins. Some, like the collagen in our skin that makes our skin tough but pliable. Like the actin and myosin in our muscles that enable us to move. Or our blood is full of hemoglobin, ferrying oxygen around. Antibodies protecting us from disease, and clotting factors that close up our wounds. And for any of you that have ever cracked a biochemistry textbook, this should look familiar. This is the metabolic chart of the human body. These are all of the reactions in your body that are keeping you alive and well right now. And each one of those reactions is catalyzed by a different protein whose names are shown here in blue. So proteins are not only what makes up the bulk of your body, they’re also what make your body tick and keep you well. Now, if we think again about buildings, the structures of buildings may look quite different in the end, but they're all made of a limited set of building materials and which of those building materials are used and how they're arranged, and how they're attached to one another gives the buildings their final form. The same is true of proteins. If we zoom down to the molecular level, we can see that proteins, if we unravel their three-dimensional architecture, are actually just long strings of building blocks. And these building blocks have different shapes and different propensities to interact with one another. So it's which building blocks are used and the order in which they are in the chain that gives a protein is three-dimensional shape. Now here I'm only showing three proteins, but creating and maintaining a healthy human requires the combined action of over 100,000 different types of protein. And our bodies make them all. Thus our bodies are remarkable protein factories. At the molecular level, the numbers are truly mind-blowing. Each of the 30 trillion cells in your body -- that's three with 13 zeros -- contains between one and 10 billion protein molecules. That means that you have as many protein molecules in your body as there are stars in the known universe. Now each different cell type in your body makes a different kind of protein, a different set of proteins, like the rods and cones in my eye that are detecting light right now and the neurons in my brain that are interpreting that light and enabling me to see you right now. So they make a particular set of proteins unique to it. And like any complex building project, you can imagine that the process of protein synthesis needs to be tightly regulated so that the right protein is made at the right time and in the right place. But of course, with anything so complicated, it's perhaps not surprising that there's an occasional mistake, a fault in the algorithm. Let's go back to that metabolic chart. It’s estimated that one in 1,000 newborns are born without the ability to make one of the proteins on this chart. Therefore, they have lifelong complications due to inborn metabolic errors. Let's take just one of those. Let's talk about von Gierke's disease or glycogen storage disease I. This is due to the lack of a protein circled here in red, whose job it is to release stored sugars so that you can maintain a healthy blood sugar level while you're fasting. So von Gierke's disease patients can't fast. They must constantly eat small amounts of carbohydrates, including getting up every one or two hours during the night to eat raw cornstarch. Now, imagine the toll that this takes on parents. If they are ever to miss a feeding of their child, their child could slip into severe hypoglycemia, seizures and possibly death. But even if these patients can keep up this endless feeding cycle, they are plagued by lifelong complications, including delayed puberty, frequent infections, kidney disease and liver cancer. So von Gierke's disease is just one example of a disorder where we know what protein is missing. What if we could give those patients back the ability to make that missing protein? Then we could actually treat their disease instead of just managing their symptoms. And that's where mRNA comes in. That's also where I come in. You see, I spent the better part of my career as an academic doing curiosity-based research into the fundamental principles of how proteins are made. And my specialty was messenger RNA. Like proteins, messenger RNAs are long chainlike molecules composed of building blocks. The four building blocks that make up messenger RNAs form what is known as the genetic code. As their name implies, messenger RNAs carry messages: messages that are translated by your body in order to create proteins. Thus messenger RNAs are the language of life. And the human body has a lot to say. So, like proteins, your cells are chock-full of messenger RNA. Every one of your 30 trillion cells has hundreds of thousands of messenger RNA molecules. Messenger RNAs are an essential component of all living organisms. So when you are eating protein-rich foods, you're not only eating protein, you're also eating lots of messenger RNA. Your body takes the messenger RNA in the food that you consumed, breaks it down into those component parts and then builds new messenger RNAs specific to your needs. Now this continual destruction and rebuilding is a feature true of almost all proteins and messenger RNAs in your body. Let's take, for example, the circadian clock. This is the timer in your body that tells you when to be active and when to sleep. The proteins that make up this clock appear and disappear with remarkable regularity every day. The way that this is accomplished is that your body makes the messenger RNAs that encode those proteins appear and disappear every day. Every day for your entire life, you get your daily dose of clock messenger RNAs producing clock proteins. Now three properties of proper medicines are that their effects are of limited duration, that their effects are dose-dependent and that they can be given over and over again to produce the same effect. mRNA's are transient. The amount of protein produced is dependent on how much of that mRNA is present. And they can be induced over and over again to produce the same effect. So wow, it seems so simple. If we could treat a disease, if there's a protein that's missing to treat a disease, then we could simply give a few copies of an mRNA to the body for it to produce that protein. If that protein's only needed once, then maybe a single dose would suffice. If a protein is needed multiple times, then we can dose mRNA over and over again. And that's exactly what's happening. So when I went on clinicaltrials.gov this morning, it turns out that there are over 175 clinical trials now open using mRNA-based medicines that are recruiting patients. Another 54 clinical trials are waiting in the [wings], ready to be opened. So there is a coming tsunami of mRNA medicines. Last year, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported positive results from a clinical trial where patients during open heart surgery were dosed with messenger RNA injected directly into their heart muscles, that told their heart muscles to grow new blood vessels in order to get around clogged arteries. In other clinical trials we're repeatedly dosing patients with inborn metabolic errors to treat their metabolic disease. In fact, one of those clinical trials that's currently recruiting patients is for von Gierke's disease. And for cancer patients, we're creating personalized cancer vaccines. These vaccines are meant to train their bodies, their immune systems, to attack their cancers. These are truly personalized medicines, one vaccine for one person. Now for personalized cancer vaccines to be the most effective, we need to get them made and back to the patient as quickly as possible. We aim for a turnaround time of 45 days. By January of 2020, we had already manufactured, quality-controlled and delivered to several dozen patients personalized cancer vaccines. So we had the know-how and the capacity to manufacture vaccines quickly. Thus, when the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was posted to a public web server on January 10, 2020, we got immediately to work. Within two days, we had agreed with our collaborators at NIH on exactly which form of the spike protein to put in our vaccine. Because we had done so so many times before, it then took our mRNA design team just one hour to design the mRNA that we immediately -- (Applause) That we immediately put on to our manufacturing equipment. We were then able to make that RNA, get it quality-controlled, fill-finished and shipped off to NIH for the clinical trial in 45 days. Now what I find -- (Applause) What I find truly remarkable is that that mRNA sequence that took us one hour to design is the same mRNA sequence that went into your arms, that ended up in Spikevax, our now fully approved vaccine. One hour to design a medicine that has saved countless lives. (Applause) It still gives me goosebumps every time I talk about it. So what does the future hold? Well, I've already told you about regenerative medicine and personalized cancer vaccines. For cancer patients, we can send in -- by directly injecting messenger RNA into their tumors -- we can send in instructions telling the tumor cells to self-destruct, Or having the tumor cells send out signals to the immune system, beckoning the immune system to attack. For patients with autoimmune disorders, we can send in signals that tamp down their overactive immune systems. And we and others are rapidly making many more messenger RNA vaccines. Because messenger RNA vaccines can be produced so quickly and rapidly, they're really well suited for newly emerging diseases as well as other viruses, like the flu, where new variants come out every year, and the vaccines need to be updated. But one of the exciting things about mRNA medicines is we're not limited to sending in the instructions for one protein at a time. mRNA medicines can be easily multiplexed. Therefore, we're working on a combination vaccine for COVID, flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV: all leading causes of hospitalization and death in the elderly. And we're hoping that this will then be an annual booster, that you will get, just like the flu vaccine. (Applause) So finally, the very modest footprint of the manufacturing equipment for making messenger RNAs means that they can be made almost anywhere in the world. And to take this to an extreme, the American Defense Department started a program in 2019, and we're working with them to miniaturize the entire process so that it can be fit into a single shipping container for rapid deployment anywhere in the world. So -- (Applause) So to finish, I hope I've convinced you that we have entered an entirely new era of medicine. Having learned to speak the language of mRNA, the language of life, we can now use it to create medicines that are just for one person, like a personalized cancer vaccine, or can be rapidly produced and distributed to entire populations, like the COVID-19 vaccines. And the best part? The best part is we're simply tapping into your body's own ability to make its own medicines. Thank you. (Applause)"

The research tells a different story. Based on the course they teach at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, behavioral scientist Jennifer Aaker and corporate strategist Naomi Bagdonas delve into the surprising power of humor: why it's a secret weapon to build bonds, power, creativity and resilience -- and how we can all have more of it.","business, creativity, leadership, work, humor",2022,"Naomi Bagdonas: Alright, so, how often do you laugh at work? I mean really laugh. We asked some of you this question, and here's what we heard. ""Rarely."" ""Seldomly."" And then our personal favorite ... (Laughter) ""I study climate change. Why would I laugh?"" The two of us teach a class at Stanford Business School about the power of humor in leadership. Jennifer Aaker: Turns out that humor is a teachable skill, and one of the most underappreciated assets at work. For the record, our class on humor gets the same academic credit as financial accounting, NB: ... which is not a joke. JA: Here is the problem, though. We've all fallen off a humor cliff. In a global study, over a million people were asked a simple question: ""Did you smile or laugh a lot, yesterday?"" When we are kids, the answer is ""yes."" Then, right when we enter the workforce, the answer becomes ""no."" The good news is things look up again around 80. (Laughter) The bad news is the average life expectancy is 78. So ... (Laughter) JA: It's not good NB: It's not great. JA: I’m a behavioral scientist who spent my career studying what actually creates happiness in life versus what we think. NB: And I'm a corporate strategist who spent my career straddling the worlds of business and improv comedy. Which was a wide straddle. The two of us are on a mission to bring humor back. Over the last decade, we have gathered data, partnered with comedians and talked to leaders about humor. One of them was our friend Connor Diemand-Yauman. Connor is the co-CEO of a large nonprofit, and in early 2020, just weeks after the world went into quarantine, he's leading his first virtual offsite with his entire organization. People are exhausted and scared, it's tense. So Connor shares a few slides before passing to another teammate to speak. But when he does, he intentionally leaves his screen-share on, so his entire organization watches, thinking that this is a terrible mistake. As Connor closes his PowerPoint, opens up a Google search, and types in ... this. [Things inspirational CEOs say during hard times] (Laughter) ""Things inspirational CEOs say during hard times."" (Laughter) Everyone laughs. It's this beautiful moment of levity, and it has real upside for Connor and for his organization, because we know from the research that leaders with a good sense of humor are seen as 27 percent more motivating. Their teams are more bonded and creative. JA: Also, humor sells. Studies show that adding a lighthearted line into a sales pitch, like ""My final offer is x ... And I'll throw in my pet frog,"" makes people willing to pay nearly 20 percent more. Really let it sink in, just how bad that joke is. (Laughter) NB: ""I'll throw in my pet frog."" JA: The bar is so low. NB: It's extreme. (Laughter) NB: Very low. JA: Could not be lower. (Laughter) JA: Laughter shortens the path to connection as well. So when strangers share a laugh before a conversation, they end up disclosing more personal information, so they feel closer. You really laughed hard at that ""pet frog"" line. I already feel close to you. Don’t we feel close? JA: Yeah, we feel close. NB: There's a lot there. NB: OK, so what's happening is when we laugh, our brains release a cocktail of hormones. So we release endorphins, giving us a similar feeling to a runner’s high; we lower our cortisol, making us feel calmer; and we release dopamine, the same hormone released during sex, making us feel more bonded. So in essence, as far as our brains are concerned, laughing is like exercising, meditating and having sex at the same time. (Laughter) But logistically easier. JA: Also, efficient. NB: Yes. NB: There's a lot to it. Alright, so humor works. And the really good news that we want to talk about today is that this humor cliff is actually easy to fix. [GLOBAL HUMOR CLIFF] (Laughter) Isn’t that better? 10 years, but we got there. Just a little Sharpie. OK, the actual good news is that our lives are full of humor, if we know how to look for it. JA: Here's the secret. Don't look for what's funny, just notice what's true. We asked some of you what's true in your own lives, and here's a few things we heard. NB: ""Since working from home, I only comb the front part of my hair."" (Laughter) JA: ""I only like my own kids ..."" (Laughter) “There, I said it.” NB: So this is not about becoming a comedian. This is about looking at the world in a different way. There's a psychological principle called the priming effect that says our brains are wired to see what we've been set up to expect. In essence, we find what we choose to look for. So when we live our lives on the precipice of a smile, we shift how we interact with the world, and in turn, how it interacts back. JA: It's also about being human, which should be easy, because we are human. But at work, it's oftentimes harder than we think. In a recent survey, people were asked ""What traits inspire trust in a leader?"" One of the top responses: ""Speaks like a regular person."" When work gets serious and life gets busy, we become transactional. And yet these small shifts are enough to move us from transactional to human. As small as a single word, like how we often sign off our emails: “Best.” What does ""best"" even mean? Are you the best? Am I the best? Why do I need to tell you that? We can do better than ""best."" Instead, how about ... NB: When you've been up all night -- ""Yours heavily caffeinated."" (Laughter) JA: When you're talking about financial accounting? ""Let's never speak of this again."" NB: And on rare occasion, ""I'm the best."" (Laughter) Sometimes, you've just got to let people know. Now, it's easy to believe that if we take our lives or our mission seriously, the presence of humor betrays that mission. That gravity and levity are somehow at odds. But our research tells a different story. JA: We met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who told us of the time when the Russian government had bugged the US State Department, a serious breach in international diplomacy. After learning about the bugging, Secretary Albright then went to her next meeting with the Russian foreign minister, wearing a bug pin. (Laughter) And enormous bug pin. (Laughter) She shared how the foreign minister couldn't help but smile, and she also shared how the energy in the room shifted, and it changed the conversation entirely. NB: This story illuminates at least two things that are true. First, that humor is a choice, one we make in small moments and in big ones, too. And second, that the balance of gravity and levity gives power to both. We can do serious things without taking ourselves so seriously, and in fact, often, we can do them better, and more fashionably. JA: Now we often hear that humor can be so tricky these days, and it's true. Comedians know this, which is why they can practice hundreds of times before a line makes it into one of their sets. They also get to wear jeans and drink whiskey at work. It's all very unfair. So how can we, as normal, non-comedian people, practice safe sets? Start by recognizing it's not about you. So don't ask ""Will this make me sound funny?"" Instead, ask: “How will this make other people feel?” NB: Which also means never punching down, that is, making fun of someone of lower status. And be sure to check your distance. How close are you personally to what you're making light of? I can make fun of my mother, but not your mother, who, by the way, I hear is a saint, a lovely lady. JA: An angel. NB: Our hope today is that you start climbing back up the humor cliff. Start with what's true, and start small. Choose to live on the precipice of a smile. When we do, we create teams, communities and families where joy and laughter come more easily. JA: Laughing together makes us feel more connected. It floods our brains with the same hormones associated with love. And who doesn't want to feel more joy and love in our lives? Where humor exists, love is not far behind. NB: And if that doesn't sell you on the power of humor, I will throw in my pet frog. (Laughter) NB: Thank you. JA: Thank you so much. (Applause)"

But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness meditation, and how it can boost your resiliency, quiet your inner critic and simply make you more pleasant to be around.","relationships, storytelling, personal growth, humor, meditation, mindfulness",2022,"A few years ago, I signed up for something called a 360 review. (Laughter) If you've ever worked in the corporate world, you probably have heard of this diabolical exercise. (Laughter) It’s an anonymous survey with your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy version of a 360 review. (Laughter) Which included my wife, my brother and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward to hearing the results. Sadists. (Laughter) But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack live on the air in 2004 while delivering some otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings, vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches and liberally using the f-word. (Laughter) To my great surprise, this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip, I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. The first 13 pages were dedicated to my sterling qualities. People talked about how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. (Laughter) The first blow was that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded, a diva and an authoritarian. (Quiet laughter) I don't know why that's funny. (Laughter) Some people even questioned my motives for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife, who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects of my personality that I was most ashamed of and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display for everybody. And those included my two most prominent and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. (Clears throat) Sorry. I've never talked about this publicly before. (Applause) Thank you. I thought we weren't supposed to applaud authoritarians here at TED. (Laughter) Bottom line, meditation had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism, even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel like our social fabric is unraveling. So after my 360, I decided to do some work on myself and to see if I could also learn some things that, by extension, might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy, communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice a kind of meditation that has been shown to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,” which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day with a gun to my head. (Laughter) But I was in it to win it. I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers and spin instructors, so -- (Laughter) And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" (Laughter) Hard pass. (Laughter) Pasadena. I was not going to do that. But over the ensuing days of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose and rugged good looks. (Laughter) And in the face of all of this roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves and a retractable jaw. After about five or six days of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude, I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing, but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based neurotic programs, probably injected into me by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them, they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment, we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. (Laughter) It's OK, sweetie. You're good at so many other things. (Laughter) (Applause) I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with your level of productivity or you have failed to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. The vastly superior alternative is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. (Laughter) As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships with other people. And because relationships are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood, not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better at loving other people. And the flip side of this was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships with other people. And as those relationships suffered, so did I. Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” (Laughter) That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply into us via evolution. It's our ability to care, cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral of self-centered self-flagellation. (Applause) Thank you. So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case for you to get your shit together. (Laughter) And the massively empowering news is that love is not an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share two with you right now that I think would be very easy to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple. Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe, may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor, somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person, somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person, probably not hard to find. And then we finish with all beings everywhere. To some of you, this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting that the research shows that this practice has physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself going down the toilet, if nobody's looking, put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people, this may be a little scary. You might fear it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach, who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360, I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,” which I think was a compliment. And another person said, “He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. (Laughter) After she finished reading, my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" (Laughter) I'm hoping that was a joke because in my opinion, upping your love game is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better when you pull your head out of your ass. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause)"
