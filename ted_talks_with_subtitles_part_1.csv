Political scientist Ian Bremmer argues it's not as simple as it used to be. With some eye-opening questions about the nature of leadership, he asks us to consider the impact of the evolving global order and our choices as participants in the future of democracy.","global issues, politics, technology, economics, social change, government, international relations",2023,"I have a big question. Which is, who runs the world? It used to be an easy question to answer. If you're over 45 like me, you grew up in a world that was dominated by two giants. The United States called the shots on one side of the Wall, the Soviets set the rules on the other. And that was a bipolar world. It's very simple. If you're under 45, you grew up when the Soviet Union had already collapsed, and that left the United States as the sole superpower, dominating global institutions and also exerting raw power. And that was a unipolar world. And then about 15 years ago, things got a little more complicated. The United States increasingly didn't want to be the world's policeman or the architect of global trade or even the cheerleader for global values. Other countries were becoming more powerful, and they could increasingly ignore many of the rules they didn't like, sometimes even setting new rules themselves. What happened? Three things. Number one, Russia was not integrated into Western institutions. A former great power now in very serious decline and they are angry about it. We can argue about whose fault that is, but we are where we are. Number two, China was integrated into US-led institutions on the presumption that as they got wealthier and more powerful, they would become Americans. Turns out, they're still Chinese. (Laughter) And the United States is not particularly comfortable with that. Number three, tens of millions of citizens in the United States and other wealthy democracies felt left behind by globalization. This has been ignored for decades. But as a consequence, they felt that their governments and their leaders were more illegitimate. Now if you look at all the headlines in the world today, driving all of this geopolitical tension and conflict, over 90 percent of them are because of these three reasons. And that's why today we live in a leaderless world. But as we know, that's not going to be with us for long. So what comes next? What kind of a world order might we expect over the next ten years? Some of what I might say I think will surprise you. Because we're not going to have a bipolar or a unipolar or even a multipolar world. If we don't have one or two superpowers, we don't have a single global order. No, instead, we will have three different orders, a little overlapping, and the third will have immense importance for how we live, what we think, what we want, and what we're prepared to do to get it. But first things first. Today, we have a global security order. And as you see from the map, the United States and its allies are the most powerful players on it. The US is the only country in the world that can send its soldiers and its sailors and its military equipment to every corner of that world. No one else is close. China is growing in its military capabilities in Asia, though nowhere else. Lots of American allies in Asia are concerned about that. And as a consequence, they're becoming more dependent on the United States for a security umbrella. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US allies in Europe are becoming more concerned and dependent on the United States and a US-led NATO. The Russian military, of course, has been a greater global concern, much less so today, especially as they've lost over 200,000 troops and all of that equipment and with sanctions making it extremely hard for them to rebuild. Now, Russia and China and others have nuclear weapons, but thank God it is still suicide to use them. And as a consequence, our security order is a unipolar order and it is likely to remain so for the next decade. Now at the same time that there's a security order, there's also a global economic order. And here, power is shared. The United States is still a very robust global economy. But the US can't use its dominant position militarily to tell other countries what to do economically. The United States and China are enormously economically interdependent and so they can't control each other. You may be surprised to hear this, but today US-China trade relations are actually at their highest level in history. Now, other countries in the world, a lot of them want access to US military muscle, but they also want access to the Chinese market, soon, by 2030, likely to be the largest in the world. And you can't very well have a cold war if the US and the Chinese are the only two that are prepared to fight it. Yes? Yes. So the European Union has the largest common market and they set the rules. And if you want to do profitable business there, you listen to those rules. India is playing a greater role economically on the global stage. Japan still matters, too. And over the next ten years, there will be a rise and fall of the relative capacities of these economies. But the global economic order is and will remain a multipolar order. Now, between these two orders are tensions because the United States will use its power in national security to try to bring more of the world's economies towards it. And we already see this starting to happen in semiconductors and in critical minerals and maybe soon in TikTok. The Chinese are trying to use their dominant commercial position to align more of the world diplomatically. And Japan and Europe and India and everyone else will do their damnedest to ensure that neither of these two orders dominate the other. And they will mostly succeed. Now, so far I have spoken with you about the two world orders we already see, but there's a third that is coming soon that's even more important. And that is the digital order. And the digital order is not run by governments but by technology companies. We all know how much military support NATO countries have provided Ukraine during the war. But it's technology companies that provided the tools allowing Ukraine to defend itself from Russian cyber attack. It's technology companies that gave the Ukrainian leaders the ability to speak with their generals and their soldiers on the front lines. If it wasn't for those technology companies, Ukraine would have been fully offline within weeks of the war. And I don't believe President Zelensky would still be there today. Technology companies determine whether Donald Trump is able, in real time and without filter, to speak with hundreds of millions of people as he runs again for the presidency. It's social media platforms and their ability to promote disinformation and conspiracy theory. Without them, we do not have riots in the Capitol on January 6. We do not have trucker riots in Ottawa. We do not have a January 8 insurrection in Brazil. Technology companies increasingly determine our identities. When I was growing up, it's nature or nurture. I mean, my deep and abiding emotional problems either come from how I was raised -- (Laughter) Or some genetic failure. (Laughter) Could be both. (Laughter) But today, our identities are determined by nature and nurture and algorithm. If you want to challenge the system, you can't just question authority, as we were all told when we were growing up. Today, you have to question the algorithm, and that is a staggering amount of power in the hands of these technology companies. What are they going to do with that power? And that depends on who they want to be when they grow up. So if China and the United States work to exert much more power over the digital world and technology companies in those countries align with those governments, we will end up in a technology cold war. And that means the digital order will be split in two. If, on the other hand technology companies persist with global business models, and we retain competition between the digital and physical worlds, we will have a new globalization, a digital global order. Or if the digital order becomes increasingly dominant and governments erode in their capacity to govern, and we've already seen the beginning of this, technology companies will become the dominant actors on the global stage in every way and we will have a techno-polar order. And that will determine whether we have a world of limitless opportunity or a world without freedom. Now at this point in my speech, I'm supposed to talk about the good news. (Laughter) But those of you that have heard this know that that is not coming. (Laughter) There is no pause button on these explosive and disruptive technologies. I don't know if you know this, there are over 100 people in the world today with the knowledge and the technology to create a new smallpox virus. Honestly, I don't have answers, but I have a few questions for the people that do. Because these technology companies are not just Fortune 50 and 100 actors. These technology titans are not just men worth 50 or 100 billion dollars or more. They are increasingly the most powerful people on the planet with influence over our futures. And we need to know, are they going to act accountably as they release new and powerful artificial intelligence? What are they going to do with this unprecedented amount of data that they are collecting on us and our environment? And the one that I think should concern us all right now the most: Will they persist with these advertising models driving so much revenues that are turning citizens into products and driving hate and misinformation and ripping apart our society? (Applause) When I was a student back in 1989, and the Wall fell, the United States was the principal exporter of democracy in the world. Not always successfully. Often hypocritically. But number one, nonetheless. Today, the United States has become the principal exporter of tools that destroy democracy. The technology leaders who create and control these tools, are they OK with that? Or are they going to do something about it? We need to know. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

He explains how Duolingo harnesses the psychological techniques of social media and mobile games to get you excited to learn — all while spreading access to education across the world.","technology, business, computers, education, communication, language, motivation, personal growth, AI, teaching, kids",2023,"So, I'm from Guatemala. This is a public service announcement, that is where Guatemala is. (Laughter) Also, that is not where they keep the prisoners. That is called Guantanamo. (Laughter) Not the same place. So Guatemala's right below Mexico. And for the Americans in the audience, and let this sink in, because it really applies in most ways, for the Americans in the audience, you can think of it as Mexico's Mexico. (Laughter) Just like the US doesn't want illegal immigration from Mexico, Mexico doesn't want illegal immigration from Guatemala. It's a smaller country. It's a poor country. And well, what can I tell you, it has much better Mexican food. (Laughter) Guatemala is a very poor country. And a lot of people talk about education as something that brings equality to different social classes. But I always saw it as the opposite, as something that brings inequality. Because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money can buy themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money. Whereas people who don't have very much money barely learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money. And this is especially true in poor countries. Now, I was fortunate that I received a rich person's education even though I didn't grow up rich. And it’s because I’m an only child. And my mother, who was a single mother, spent all of her resources on my education. And this allowed me to come to college to the US and eventually get a PhD in computer science. Now because of all of this about 10 years ago, I decided I wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone. Oh, by the way, this is what I want to talk to you about today, giving equal access to education to everyone. At the time, I was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I decided to work on this with my PhD student, Severin. The way my brain works, all of education is just too general of a problem. So I decided, let's start by teaching one thing. And then I started thinking, OK, well, what should we teach first? Should we teach math? I mean, we both love math. Me and my cofounder, we both love math. And, you know, we didn't decide to do math. Then we started thinking, well, maybe we should teach computer science. But eventually, and this is maybe surprising to people in North America, eventually, we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages. And let me tell you why. There's a number of reasons. One of them is that there's a huge audience for it. There’s about two billion people in the world learning a foreign language, both in school and outside of schools. Most of these people, by the way, are learning English. About 80 percent of them are learning English. In this weird map right here, all the countries in green are countries in which people are predominantly learning English. And the reason for that is because English can truly transform your life. In most countries in the world, knowledge of English can significantly increase your income potential. So this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages. And it's because you can directly make more money if you learn another language, in particular English. And see, this is pretty different than many other subjects. For example, take math. In the case of math, just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to then become a civil engineer, that's how you make more money. Whereas with languages, if you are a waiter and you learn English, now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money. So we decided, well, let's get started by teaching languages. Now, we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people was by using a mobile phone, or a smartphone in particular. See, building schools all over the world is simply too expensive. On the other hand, most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone, and the trend is that that fraction is only going to increase. So we decided at the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone. And then we called it Duolingo. Thank you. (Applause) Now in order to truly be accessible to everyone, rich and poor, Duolingo uses a freemium model to support itself. What that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay. But if you don't pay, you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson. Now, if you don't like ads, you can also pay to subscribe to turn off the ads. And it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for Duolingo comes from people who pay to subscribe to turn off the ads. Now, who are these people who pay to subscribe to turn off the ads? Well, they're usually well-off people in rich countries like the US and Canada. Who are the people who don't pay to subscribe? They usually come from poorer countries like Brazil or Vietnam or Guatemala. So what I like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically getting the rich people to pay for the education of everyone. So I like that. (Applause) So with smartphones, we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing, which is great. However, if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone, you run into a humongous problem. And it is that smartphones come equipped with some of the most addictive drugs that humanity has ever engineered. TikTok, Instagram, mobile games. See, delivering education over a smartphone is like hoping that people will eat their broccoli, but right next to it, you put the most delicious dessert ever made. (Laughter) If you really want to deliver education to everyone, not only do you have to make it accessible, but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn. And with Duolingo, we've been able to do this. And at the highest level, the way we've done this is by making the broccoli taste like dessert. I'll say it another way. What we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that apps like Instagram, TikTok or mobile games use to keep people engaged, but in this case, we use them to keep people engaged but with education. Let me give you some examples of these techniques. One of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak. What a streak is, is it’s just a counter that measures the number of days that you've used the product consecutively. You just take that number, you put it very prominently in your product and then people come back every day. And the reason people come back every day is because, well, if they don't come back, that number resets to zero and people don't want to lose their streak. It works. Now, on the one side, streaks have been criticized for, for example, getting teens addicted to Snapchat. But in the case of an educational app, streaks get people to come back to study every day. Now, to give you an idea of the power of streaks, in the case of Duolingo, we have over three million daily active users that have a streak longer than 365. (Applause) That means they haven't missed a day in the last year or longer. Now, fun fact about streaks. What country do you think has the longest average streaks for an educational app? It's Japan. Of course. Shortest-ever streaks? Latin America, baby. (Laughter) But we're fun, hey, we're fun. (Laughter) Another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product are notifications. On the one side, notifications can be really spammy and annoying, but in the case of an educational product, people actually want to be reminded to learn. In the case of Duolingo, we have a very sophisticated AI system that basically chooses when to send the notification and also what to say in each notification to maximize the probability that people come back. Now, interestingly, even after all this sophistication, it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what time to send you a notification is pretty simple. Do you know what is the best time to send people a notification? I'll tell you. It's 24 hours after they used the product last. There's an easy explanation. If you were free yesterday at 3pm, you’re probably free today at 3pm as well. So this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of AI found. (Laughter) It's funny. Now with notifications you shouldn't be spamming. And we're not spamming, with Duolingo, we actually stop sending notifications after seven days of inactivity. So if you don't use Duolingo for seven days, we stop sending you notifications. Now, at some point it occurred to us, if we're stopping to send people notifications, we should let them know. So we started sending this notification to people saying, ""Hey, these reminders don't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now."" You know what people do when they get this notification? They come back. (Laughter) Passive aggressive. (Laughter) Works for my mother, works for Duolingo. (Laughter and applause) These passive aggressive notifications are really good at getting people to come back back because they feel like our green owl mascot has given up on them, so they come back. And speaking of our green owl mascot, by the way, because all our notifications come from our green owl mascot and well, he's passive aggressive and also pretty pushy, this has given rise to a lot of memes on the internet that make fun of the great lengths that he will go through to get you back to learn a language. Here's one of my favorite ones. This is it's a meme, it’s one of my favorite ones. (Laughter) Basically looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons. And then there's an intruder alert, presumably the owl broke into your house to get you to learn language. Now, Duolingo has entered the zeitgeist. And there's thousands of memes, there's SNL skits about it. And it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that mobile games and social media use to get people engaged. And this is a really important point, let me say this. I don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app be as engaging as something like TikTok or Instagram or mobile games. But the good news is that -- And by the way, the reason I don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something. And it's hard to compete with, like, cats and celebrities. But the good news is that I don't think you have to. See, here's the thing. When you're learning something, you get meaning out of it. Whereas when you're scrolling for two hours on Instagram, a lot of times afterwards, you feel like you just wasted your time. So I think it's actually OK if your educational product is only 80 or 90 percent as engaging as something like TikTok, because the other 10 or 20 percent will be provided by people's internal motivation, though of course, not much more than that. This is really a key point. If we want to get people to do something meaningful, you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it. And even if you're not as engaging as those apps are, you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product. In the case of Duolingo, for example, there are more people learning languages on Duolingo in the United States than there are people learning languages across all US high schools combined. (Applause) And this is true in most countries in the world. My hope is that -- I know we can do this, but, you know, my hope is that as humanity, we can do what Duolingo has done for learning languages but for all other subjects. Where we can get people to learn math with mobile phones, like millions of people to learn math with mobile phones or physics or whatever. I hope for a future in which screen time is not a bad thing, in which we can deliver high-quality education to everyone, rich or poor, using a mobile phone. But the single most important thing that I can end this talk with, is a reminder to please, pretty please, I beg you, do your language lessons today. Thank you very much. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Luis, thank you so much. I wonder if you can just say a little bit more about that last point, how do you think you can apply this type of thinking to other subjects? So you mentioned math, and things like that. How do you do that? Luis von Ahn: I think in particular, subjects that are learned through repetition and it turns out most things that are kind of really meaningful are learned through thousands of repetitions. You learn to read through repetition, you learn elementary school math through repetition. Most things that you can learn through repetition, you can actually gamify and turn into something like Duolingo, where people just do it a lot and do it fun. It's a little harder for things like explanations. That probably is going to require some really good videos. Sal Khan is doing a really good job with that. But for things that require a lot of repetition, I think we can use the same methods. (Applause)"

After the talk, head of TED Chris Anderson joins Brockman to dig into the timeline of ChatGPT's development and get Brockman's take on the risks, raised by many in the tech industry and beyond, of releasing such a powerful tool into the world.","technology, computers, innovation, creativity, future, language, AI, machine learning",2023,"We started OpenAI seven years ago because we felt like something really interesting was happening in AI and we wanted to help steer it in a positive direction. It's honestly just really amazing to see how far this whole field has come since then. And it's really gratifying to hear from people like Raymond who are using the technology we are building, and others, for so many wonderful things. We hear from people who are excited, we hear from people who are concerned, we hear from people who feel both those emotions at once. And honestly, that's how we feel. Above all, it feels like we're entering an historic period right now where we as a world are going to define a technology that will be so important for our society going forward. And I believe that we can manage this for good. So today, I want to show you the current state of that technology and some of the underlying design principles that we hold dear. So the first thing I'm going to show you is what it's like to build a tool for an AI rather than building it for a human. So we have a new DALL-E model, which generates images, and we are exposing it as an app for ChatGPT to use on your behalf. And you can do things like ask, you know, suggest a nice post-TED meal and draw a picture of it. (Laughter) Now you get all of the, sort of, ideation and creative back-and-forth and taking care of the details for you that you get out of ChatGPT. And here we go, it's not just the idea for the meal, but a very, very detailed spread. So let's see what we're going to get. But ChatGPT doesn't just generate images in this case -- sorry, it doesn't generate text, it also generates an image. And that is something that really expands the power of what it can do on your behalf in terms of carrying out your intent. And I'll point out, this is all a live demo. This is all generated by the AI as we speak. So I actually don't even know what we're going to see. This looks wonderful. (Applause) I'm getting hungry just looking at it. Now we've extended ChatGPT with other tools too, for example, memory. You can say ""save this for later."" And the interesting thing about these tools is they're very inspectable. So you get this little pop up here that says ""use the DALL-E app."" And by the way, this is coming to you, all ChatGPT users, over upcoming months. And you can look under the hood and see that what it actually did was write a prompt just like a human could. And so you sort of have this ability to inspect how the machine is using these tools, which allows us to provide feedback to them. Now it's saved for later, and let me show you what it's like to use that information and to integrate with other applications too. You can say, “Now make a shopping list for the tasty thing I was suggesting earlier.” And make it a little tricky for the AI. ""And tweet it out for all the TED viewers out there."" (Laughter) So if you do make this wonderful, wonderful meal, I definitely want to know how it tastes. But you can see that ChatGPT is selecting all these different tools without me having to tell it explicitly which ones to use in any situation. And this, I think, shows a new way of thinking about the user interface. Like, we are so used to thinking of, well, we have these apps, we click between them, we copy/paste between them, and usually it's a great experience within an app as long as you kind of know the menus and know all the options. Yes, I would like you to. Yes, please. Always good to be polite. (Laughter) And by having this unified language interface on top of tools, the AI is able to sort of take away all those details from you. So you don't have to be the one who spells out every single sort of little piece of what's supposed to happen. And as I said, this is a live demo, so sometimes the unexpected will happen to us. But let's take a look at the Instacart shopping list while we're at it. And you can see we sent a list of ingredients to Instacart. Here's everything you need. And the thing that's really interesting is that the traditional UI is still very valuable, right? If you look at this, you still can click through it and sort of modify the actual quantities. And that's something that I think shows that they're not going away, traditional UIs. It's just we have a new, augmented way to build them. And now we have a tweet that's been drafted for our review, which is also a very important thing. We can click “run,” and there we are, we’re the manager, we’re able to inspect, we're able to change the work of the AI if we want to. And so after this talk, you will be able to access this yourself. And there we go. Cool. Thank you, everyone. (Applause) So we’ll cut back to the slides. Now, the important thing about how we build this, it's not just about building these tools. It's about teaching the AI how to use them. Like, what do we even want it to do when we ask these very high-level questions? And to do this, we use an old idea. If you go back to Alan Turing's 1950 paper on the Turing test, he says, you'll never program an answer to this. Instead, you can learn it. You could build a machine, like a human child, and then teach it through feedback. Have a human teacher who provides rewards and punishments as it tries things out and does things that are either good or bad. And this is exactly how we train ChatGPT. It's a two-step process. First, we produce what Turing would have called a child machine through an unsupervised learning process. We just show it the whole world, the whole internet and say, “Predict what comes next in text you’ve never seen before.” And this process imbues it with all sorts of wonderful skills. For example, if you're shown a math problem, the only way to actually complete that math problem, to say what comes next, that green nine up there, is to actually solve the math problem. But we actually have to do a second step, too, which is to teach the AI what to do with those skills. And for this, we provide feedback. We have the AI try out multiple things, give us multiple suggestions, and then a human rates them, says “This one’s better than that one.” And this reinforces not just the specific thing that the AI said, but very importantly, the whole process that the AI used to produce that answer. And this allows it to generalize. It allows it to teach, to sort of infer your intent and apply it in scenarios that it hasn't seen before, that it hasn't received feedback. Now, sometimes the things we have to teach the AI are not what you'd expect. For example, when we first showed GPT-4 to Khan Academy, they said, ""Wow, this is so great, We're going to be able to teach students wonderful things. Only one problem, it doesn't double-check students' math. If there's some bad math in there, it will happily pretend that one plus one equals three and run with it."" So we had to collect some feedback data. Sal Khan himself was very kind and offered 20 hours of his own time to provide feedback to the machine alongside our team. And over the course of a couple of months we were able to teach the AI that, ""Hey, you really should push back on humans in this specific kind of scenario."" And we've actually made lots and lots of improvements to the models this way. And when you push that thumbs down in ChatGPT, that actually is kind of like sending up a bat signal to our team to say, “Here’s an area of weakness where you should gather feedback.” And so when you do that, that's one way that we really listen to our users and make sure we're building something that's more useful for everyone. Now, providing high-quality feedback is a hard thing. If you think about asking a kid to clean their room, if all you're doing is inspecting the floor, you don't know if you're just teaching them to stuff all the toys in the closet. This is a nice DALL-E-generated image, by the way. And the same sort of reasoning applies to AI. As we move to harder tasks, we will have to scale our ability to provide high-quality feedback. But for this, the AI itself is happy to help. It's happy to help us provide even better feedback and to scale our ability to supervise the machine as time goes on. And let me show you what I mean. For example, you can ask GPT-4 a question like this, of how much time passed between these two foundational blogs on unsupervised learning and learning from human feedback. And the model says two months passed. But is it true? Like, these models are not 100-percent reliable, although they’re getting better every time we provide some feedback. But we can actually use the AI to fact-check. And it can actually check its own work. You can say, fact-check this for me. Now, in this case, I've actually given the AI a new tool. This one is a browsing tool where the model can issue search queries and click into web pages. And it actually writes out its whole chain of thought as it does it. It says, I’m just going to search for this and it actually does the search. It then it finds the publication date and the search results. It then is issuing another search query. It's going to click into the blog post. And all of this you could do, but it’s a very tedious task. It's not a thing that humans really want to do. It's much more fun to be in the driver's seat, to be in this manager's position where you can, if you want, triple-check the work. And out come citations so you can actually go and very easily verify any piece of this whole chain of reasoning. And it actually turns out two months was wrong. Two months and one week, that was correct. (Applause) And we'll cut back to the side. And so thing that's so interesting to me about this whole process is that it’s this many-step collaboration between a human and an AI. Because a human, using this fact-checking tool is doing it in order to produce data for another AI to become more useful to a human. And I think this really shows the shape of something that we should expect to be much more common in the future, where we have humans and machines kind of very carefully and delicately designed in how they fit into a problem and how we want to solve that problem. We make sure that the humans are providing the management, the oversight, the feedback, and the machines are operating in a way that's inspectable and trustworthy. And together we're able to actually create even more trustworthy machines. And I think that over time, if we get this process right, we will be able to solve impossible problems. And to give you a sense of just how impossible I'm talking, I think we're going to be able to rethink almost every aspect of how we interact with computers. For example, think about spreadsheets. They've been around in some form since, we'll say, 40 years ago with VisiCalc. I don't think they've really changed that much in that time. And here is a specific spreadsheet of all the AI papers on the arXiv for the past 30 years. There's about 167,000 of them. And you can see there the data right here. But let me show you the ChatGPT take on how to analyze a data set like this. So we can give ChatGPT access to yet another tool, this one a Python interpreter, so it’s able to run code, just like a data scientist would. And so you can just literally upload a file and ask questions about it. And very helpfully, you know, it knows the name of the file and it's like, ""Oh, this is CSV,"" comma-separated value file, ""I'll parse it for you."" The only information here is the name of the file, the column names like you saw and then the actual data. And from that it's able to infer what these columns actually mean. Like, that semantic information wasn't in there. It has to sort of, put together its world knowledge of knowing that, “Oh yeah, arXiv is a site that people submit papers and therefore that's what these things are and that these are integer values and so therefore it's a number of authors in the paper,"" like all of that, that’s work for a human to do, and the AI is happy to help with it. Now I don't even know what I want to ask. So fortunately, you can ask the machine, ""Can you make some exploratory graphs?"" And once again, this is a super high-level instruction with lots of intent behind it. But I don't even know what I want. And the AI kind of has to infer what I might be interested in. And so it comes up with some good ideas, I think. So a histogram of the number of authors per paper, time series of papers per year, word cloud of the paper titles. All of that, I think, will be pretty interesting to see. And the great thing is, it can actually do it. Here we go, a nice bell curve. You see that three is kind of the most common. It's going to then make this nice plot of the papers per year. Something crazy is happening in 2023, though. Looks like we were on an exponential and it dropped off the cliff. What could be going on there? By the way, all this is Python code, you can inspect. And then we'll see word cloud. So you can see all these wonderful things that appear in these titles. But I'm pretty unhappy about this 2023 thing. It makes this year look really bad. Of course, the problem is that the year is not over. So I'm going to push back on the machine. [Waitttt that's not fair!!! 2023 isn't over. What percentage of papers in 2022 were even posted by April 13?] So April 13 was the cut-off date I believe. Can you use that to make a fair projection? So we'll see, this is the kind of ambitious one. (Laughter) So you know, again, I feel like there was more I wanted out of the machine here. I really wanted it to notice this thing, maybe it's a little bit of an overreach for it to have sort of, inferred magically that this is what I wanted. But I inject my intent, I provide this additional piece of, you know, guidance. And under the hood, the AI is just writing code again, so if you want to inspect what it's doing, it's very possible. And now, it does the correct projection. (Applause) If you noticed, it even updates the title. I didn't ask for that, but it know what I want. Now we'll cut back to the slide again. This slide shows a parable of how I think we ... A vision of how we may end up using this technology in the future. A person brought his very sick dog to the vet, and the veterinarian made a bad call to say, “Let’s just wait and see.” And the dog would not be here today had he listened. In the meanwhile, he provided the blood test, like, the full medical records, to GPT-4, which said, ""I am not a vet, you need to talk to a professional, here are some hypotheses."" He brought that information to a second vet who used it to save the dog's life. Now, these systems, they're not perfect. You cannot overly rely on them. But this story, I think, shows that a human with a medical professional and with ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner was able to achieve an outcome that would not have happened otherwise. I think this is something we should all reflect on, think about as we consider how to integrate these systems into our world. And one thing I believe really deeply, is that getting AI right is going to require participation from everyone. And that's for deciding how we want it to slot in, that's for setting the rules of the road, for what an AI will and won't do. And if there's one thing to take away from this talk, it's that this technology just looks different. Just different from anything people had anticipated. And so we all have to become literate. And that's, honestly, one of the reasons we released ChatGPT. Together, I believe that we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson: Greg. Wow. I mean ... I suspect that within every mind out here there's a feeling of reeling. Like, I suspect that a very large number of people viewing this, you look at that and you think, “Oh my goodness, pretty much every single thing about the way I work, I need to rethink."" Like, there's just new possibilities there. Am I right? Who thinks that they're having to rethink the way that we do things? Yeah, I mean, it's amazing, but it's also really scary. So let's talk, Greg, let's talk. I mean, I guess my first question actually is just how the hell have you done this? (Laughter) OpenAI has a few hundred employees. Google has thousands of employees working on artificial intelligence. Why is it you who's come up with this technology that shocked the world? Greg Brockman: I mean, the truth is, we're all building on shoulders of giants, right, there's no question. If you look at the compute progress, the algorithmic progress, the data progress, all of those are really industry-wide. But I think within OpenAI, we made a lot of very deliberate choices from the early days. And the first one was just to confront reality as it lays. And that we just thought really hard about like: What is it going to take to make progress here? We tried a lot of things that didn't work, so you only see the things that did. And I think that the most important thing has been to get teams of people who are very different from each other to work together harmoniously. CA: Can we have the water, by the way, just brought here? I think we're going to need it, it's a dry-mouth topic. But isn't there something also just about the fact that you saw something in these language models that meant that if you continue to invest in them and grow them, that something at some point might emerge? GB: Yes. And I think that, I mean, honestly, I think the story there is pretty illustrative, right? I think that high level, deep learning, like we always knew that was what we wanted to be, was a deep learning lab, and exactly how to do it? I think that in the early days, we didn't know. We tried a lot of things, and one person was working on training a model to predict the next character in Amazon reviews, and he got a result where -- this is a syntactic process, you expect, you know, the model will predict where the commas go, where the nouns and verbs are. But he actually got a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis classifier out of it. This model could tell you if a review was positive or negative. I mean, today we are just like, come on, anyone can do that. But this was the first time that you saw this emergence, this sort of semantics that emerged from this underlying syntactic process. And there we knew, you've got to scale this thing, you've got to see where it goes. CA: So I think this helps explain the riddle that baffles everyone looking at this, because these things are described as prediction machines. And yet, what we're seeing out of them feels ... it just feels impossible that that could come from a prediction machine. Just the stuff you showed us just now. And the key idea of emergence is that when you get more of a thing, suddenly different things emerge. It happens all the time, ant colonies, single ants run around, when you bring enough of them together, you get these ant colonies that show completely emergent, different behavior. Or a city where a few houses together, it's just houses together. But as you grow the number of houses, things emerge, like suburbs and cultural centers and traffic jams. Give me one moment for you when you saw just something pop that just blew your mind that you just did not see coming. GB: Yeah, well, so you can try this in ChatGPT, if you add 40-digit numbers -- CA: 40-digit? GB: 40-digit numbers, the model will do it, which means it's really learned an internal circuit for how to do it. And the really interesting thing is actually, if you have it add like a 40-digit number plus a 35-digit number, it'll often get it wrong. And so you can see that it's really learning the process, but it hasn't fully generalized, right? It's like you can't memorize the 40-digit addition table, that's more atoms than there are in the universe. So it had to have learned something general, but that it hasn't really fully yet learned that, Oh, I can sort of generalize this to adding arbitrary numbers of arbitrary lengths. CA: So what's happened here is that you've allowed it to scale up and look at an incredible number of pieces of text. And it is learning things that you didn't know that it was going to be capable of learning. GB Well, yeah, and it’s more nuanced, too. So one science that we’re starting to really get good at is predicting some of these emergent capabilities. And to do that actually, one of the things I think is very undersung in this field is sort of engineering quality. Like, we had to rebuild our entire stack. When you think about building a rocket, every tolerance has to be incredibly tiny. Same is true in machine learning. You have to get every single piece of the stack engineered properly, and then you can start doing these predictions. There are all these incredibly smooth scaling curves. They tell you something deeply fundamental about intelligence. If you look at our GPT-4 blog post, you can see all of these curves in there. And now we're starting to be able to predict. So we were able to predict, for example, the performance on coding problems. We basically look at some models that are 10,000 times or 1,000 times smaller. And so there's something about this that is actually smooth scaling, even though it's still early days. CA: So here is, one of the big fears then, that arises from this. If it’s fundamental to what’s happening here, that as you scale up, things emerge that you can maybe predict in some level of confidence, but it's capable of surprising you. Why isn't there just a huge risk of something truly terrible emerging? GB: Well, I think all of these are questions of degree and scale and timing. And I think one thing people miss, too, is sort of the integration with the world is also this incredibly emergent, sort of, very powerful thing too. And so that's one of the reasons that we think it's so important to deploy incrementally. And so I think that what we kind of see right now, if you look at this talk, a lot of what I focus on is providing really high-quality feedback. Today, the tasks that we do, you can inspect them, right? It's very easy to look at that math problem and be like, no, no, no, machine, seven was the correct answer. But even summarizing a book, like, that's a hard thing to supervise. Like, how do you know if this book summary is any good? You have to read the whole book. No one wants to do that. (Laughter) And so I think that the important thing will be that we take this step by step. And that we say, OK, as we move on to book summaries, we have to supervise this task properly. We have to build up a track record with these machines that they're able to actually carry out our intent. And I think we're going to have to produce even better, more efficient, more reliable ways of scaling this, sort of like making the machine be aligned with you. CA: So we're going to hear later in this session, there are critics who say that, you know, there's no real understanding inside, the system is going to always -- we're never going to know that it's not generating errors, that it doesn't have common sense and so forth. Is it your belief, Greg, that it is true at any one moment, but that the expansion of the scale and the human feedback that you talked about is basically going to take it on that journey of actually getting to things like truth and wisdom and so forth, with a high degree of confidence. Can you be sure of that? GB: Yeah, well, I think that the OpenAI, I mean, the short answer is yes, I believe that is where we're headed. And I think that the OpenAI approach here has always been just like, let reality hit you in the face, right? It's like this field is the field of broken promises, of all these experts saying X is going to happen, Y is how it works. People have been saying neural nets aren't going to work for 70 years. They haven't been right yet. They might be right maybe 70 years plus one or something like that is what you need. But I think that our approach has always been, you've got to push to the limits of this technology to really see it in action, because that tells you then, oh, here's how we can move on to a new paradigm. And we just haven't exhausted the fruit here. CA: I mean, it's quite a controversial stance you've taken, that the right way to do this is to put it out there in public and then harness all this, you know, instead of just your team giving feedback, the world is now giving feedback. But ... If, you know, bad things are going to emerge, it is out there. So, you know, the original story that I heard on OpenAI when you were founded as a nonprofit, well you were there as the great sort of check on the big companies doing their unknown, possibly evil thing with AI. And you were going to build models that sort of, you know, somehow held them accountable and was capable of slowing the field down, if need be. Or at least that's kind of what I heard. And yet, what's happened, arguably, is the opposite. That your release of GPT, especially ChatGPT, sent such shockwaves through the tech world that now Google and Meta and so forth are all scrambling to catch up. And some of their criticisms have been, you are forcing us to put this out here without proper guardrails or we die. You know, how do you, like, make the case that what you have done is responsible here and not reckless. GB: Yeah, we think about these questions all the time. Like, seriously all the time. And I don't think we're always going to get it right. But one thing I think has been incredibly important, from the very beginning, when we were thinking about how to build artificial general intelligence, actually have it benefit all of humanity, like, how are you supposed to do that, right? And that default plan of being, well, you build in secret, you get this super powerful thing, and then you figure out the safety of it and then you push “go,” and you hope you got it right. I don't know how to execute that plan. Maybe someone else does. But for me, that was always terrifying, it didn't feel right. And so I think that this alternative approach is the only other path that I see, which is that you do let reality hit you in the face. And I think you do give people time to give input. You do have, before these machines are perfect, before they are super powerful, that you actually have the ability to see them in action. And we've seen it from GPT-3, right? GPT-3, we really were afraid that the number one thing people were going to do with it was generate misinformation, try to tip elections. Instead, the number one thing was generating Viagra spam. (Laughter) CA: So Viagra spam is bad, but there are things that are much worse. Here's a thought experiment for you. Suppose you're sitting in a room, there's a box on the table. You believe that in that box is something that, there's a very strong chance it's something absolutely glorious that's going to give beautiful gifts to your family and to everyone. But there's actually also a one percent thing in the small print there that says: “Pandora.” And there's a chance that this actually could unleash unimaginable evils on the world. Do you open that box? GB: Well, so, absolutely not. I think you don't do it that way. And honestly, like, I'll tell you a story that I haven't actually told before, which is that shortly after we started OpenAI, I remember I was in Puerto Rico for an AI conference. I'm sitting in the hotel room just looking out over this wonderful water, all these people having a good time. And you think about it for a moment, if you could choose for basically that Pandora’s box to be five years away or 500 years away, which would you pick, right? On the one hand you're like, well, maybe for you personally, it's better to have it be five years away. But if it gets to be 500 years away and people get more time to get it right, which do you pick? And you know, I just really felt it in the moment. I was like, of course you do the 500 years. My brother was in the military at the time and like, he puts his life on the line in a much more real way than any of us typing things in computers and developing this technology at the time. And so, yeah, I'm really sold on the you've got to approach this right. But I don't think that's quite playing the field as it truly lies. Like, if you look at the whole history of computing, I really mean it when I say that this is an industry-wide or even just almost like a human-development- of-technology-wide shift. And the more that you sort of, don't put together the pieces that are there, right, we're still making faster computers, we're still improving the algorithms, all of these things, they are happening. And if you don't put them together, you get an overhang, which means that if someone does, or the moment that someone does manage to connect to the circuit, then you suddenly have this very powerful thing, no one's had any time to adjust, who knows what kind of safety precautions you get. And so I think that one thing I take away is like, even you think about development of other sort of technologies, think about nuclear weapons, people talk about being like a zero to one, sort of, change in what humans could do. But I actually think that if you look at capability, it's been quite smooth over time. And so the history, I think, of every technology we've developed has been, you've got to do it incrementally and you've got to figure out how to manage it for each moment that you're increasing it. CA: So what I'm hearing is that you ... the model you want us to have is that we have birthed this extraordinary child that may have superpowers that take humanity to a whole new place. It is our collective responsibility to provide the guardrails for this child to collectively teach it to be wise and not to tear us all down. Is that basically the model? GB: I think it's true. And I think it's also important to say this may shift, right? We've got to take each step as we encounter it. And I think it's incredibly important today that we all do get literate in this technology, figure out how to provide the feedback, decide what we want from it. And my hope is that that will continue to be the best path, but it's so good we're honestly having this debate because we wouldn't otherwise if it weren't out there. CA: Greg Brockman, thank you so much for coming to TED and blowing our minds. (Applause)"

He gives a sneak peek of his company's new product -- shown for the first time ever on the TED stage -- and explains how it could change the way we interact with tech and the world around us.","technology, invention, computers, future, communication, AI, machine learning",2023,"I spent 22 incredible years at Apple, helping to design experiences and devices ranging from the Mac to the iPhone to the Apple Watch. And as the power of compute increased, the size of our computers or our devices decreased. The desktop paved the way for extraordinary interconnectedness, but it was stuck to your desk. The laptop provided portability, but you still had to be sitting down to use it. And the smartphone evolved us into the modern, connected humans we are, providing millions the ability to access the internet from our pockets. And the smart watch was a window to that phone. A companion device with a whole host of health insights, all shrunk down to your wrist. But what comes next? Some believe AR/VR glasses like these are the answer, but they merely move the screens we already have in our lives today to being just millimeters away from our eyeballs. A further barrier between you and the world. And the future is not on your face. In fact, in 2017, the legendary tech journalist Walt Mossberg wrote in his final column that he felt that soon, one day, technology would become invisible. And that the computer would disappear. And we agree. (Ringing) Sorry. This is my wife. I'm going to have to get this. Hello? Bethany Bongiorno: Hey, babe. IC: Hey, Bethany. How's it going? BB: Good. Are you at TED? IC: Yeah, I'm on the red circle right now, actually. Bethany: Oh, great, good luck. And don't forget to mention me. (Laughter) IC: I won't, babe, thank you. Bethany: Love you. IC: Love you, too. Bye. It's going to get different in a minute. (Applause) So my wife, Bethany, and our entire company, Humane, have been working to answer the question of what comes next. And you may ask yourself, why? Why would anybody do this? It's because we love building technology that genuinely makes people's lives better. And we believe that artificial intelligence or AI would be the driving force behind the next leap in device design. And there is an incredible amount of stuff that's happening in this space. Huge, huge advancements. And even Bill Gates has said of OpenAI's GPT that it's only the second most revolutionary technology demonstration that he's seen in his entire lifetime. But what do we do with all these incredible developments, and how do we actually harness these to genuinely make our life better? If we get this right, AI will unlock a world of possibility for all of us. And today I want to share with you what we think is a solution to that end. And it's the first time we're doing so openly. It's a new kind of wearable device and platform that's built entirely from the ground up for artificial intelligence. And is completely standalone. You don't need a smartphone or any other device to pair with it. In fact, I'm wearing one right now. And it interacts with the world the way you interact with the world. Hearing what you hear, seeing what you see. While being privacy-first and safe and completely fading into the background of your life. We like to say that the experience is screenless, seamless and sensing, allowing you to access the power of compute while remaining present in your surroundings, fixing a balance that's felt out of place for some time now. And I can't wait to share more details about what we've built, and I will in the next few months. But today I want to talk to you about what it unlocks. And what it means to be able to take AI with you everywhere. And what happens when technology increasingly disappears. Technology becoming invisible affords us new opportunities of how we interact with compute. We've become so accustomed to tapping on an app or moving a cursor with a mouse that it feels second nature. But that's by design. When I was working on the iPhone, I used to test interactions like slide-to-unlock with my infant daughter. She was the best possible focus group. She’s 16 now, and she's got a lot more ideas than she did back then. This also, by the way, is the only non-AI generated image that you'll see from me today. And as I look at it now, I see more than ever why a future driven by AI is far better than a future that would involve more screens. Like this. He's cute, though. But for the human-technology relationship to actually evolve beyond screens, we need something radically different. Let me show you. Where can I find a gift for my wife before I have to leave tomorrow? (Voice) Vancouver's Granville Island is a lively shopping district. IC: That's an incredibly simple response for a very complex query. How often do we find ourselves in a new city, wrestling with our phones, trying not to bump into people, trying to figure out where we're going and where we're supposed to be? It's even harder when we don't speak the language, right? Let me show you something. Invisible devices should feel so natural to use that you almost forget about their existence. (Voice speaking in French) IC: You'll note that's me and my voice, speaking fluent French, using an AI speech model that's part of my own AI. This is not a deepfake. In fact, it's deeply profound. This is my AI giving me the ability to speak any language and you having a chance to hear me speak that language in my own emotion and my own voice. Thank you. (Applause) This is moving away from the experiments that make us all concerned about the direction compute is going in. But it's instead using technology to create real, responsible compute products that are in service to us and built on trust. This is good AI in action. And we spent thousands of hours reimagining and redesigning new types of compute interactions, ranging from complex voice commands to intricate hand gestures, all in service of trying to find more natural ways to interact with compute. Why fumble for your phone when you can just hold an object and ask questions about it? The result almost feels like the entire world becomes your operating system. And when compute disappears, it allows us to get back to what really matters: a new ability to be present. Like riding a bicycle in the park and just ripping through emails or going to a concert without having to hold up your phone to capture it. Or experiencing your toddler's first steps without a screen between you and your child. In the future, technology will be both ambient and contextual. And this means harnessing AI to really understand you and your surroundings in order to achieve the best results. Imagine this. You've been in meetings all day and you just want a summary of what you've missed. Catch me up. (Voice) Patrick is coming to tomorrow's design meeting. Bethany wants to move next week's dinner, and Oliver is asking about soccer this weekend. IC: These are emails, calendar invites and messages, all surfaced up to the top. You can use these to help guide your decision making, manage your workload and sculpt tailored responses in your own voice. And in the context of your life. And we gain this context through machine learning. The more you use our device powered by AI, the more we can help you in all times of need. Your AI effectively becomes an ever-evolving, personalized form of memory. And we think that's amazing. In fact, let's say you're health conscious or you have certain types of food considerations. Let me just show you. Picked up one of these chocolates. Used to eat a ton of these when I was a kid. Can I eat this? (Voice) A milky bar contains cocoa butter. Given your intolerance, you may want to avoid it. IC: So I can’t eat these anymore. (Applause) But what's cool is my AI knows what's best for me. But I'm in total control. I'm going to eat it anyway. (Laughter) (Voice) Enjoy it. (Laughter) IC: Your AI figures out exactly what you need. And by the way, I love that there's no judgment. I think it's amazing to be able to live freely. Your AI figures out what you need at the speed of thought. A sense that will ever be evolving as technology improves too. And these examples are just the start. As AI advances, we will see how it will transform nearly every aspect of our lives. In ways that will seem unimaginable right now. In fact, Sam Altman from OpenAI feels the way we do. And that AI is grossly underestimated. And I'll add, so long as we get it right. We really believe that we're only beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible. Embed advancements of AI, like in our device that's actually built to disappear and allow experiences to come forward, and we open up entirely new possible ways of how you interact with technology and how you interact with the world around you. More humane, intuitive interactions that are screenless, seamless and sensing. This is so much more than devices just getting smaller or more powerful. This is the possibility of reimagining the human-technology relationship as we know it. And that's what's so exciting. It's a huge challenge, no doubt. But it's the world that we want to live in. One where technology not only helps you get back into the world but enhances our ability to do so. It's within reach. And you saw some of it today. The future will not be held in your hand, and it won't be on your face either. The future of technology might almost be invisible. Thank you. (Applause)"

He shares the opportunities he sees for students and educators to collaborate with AI tools -- including the potential of a personal AI tutor for every student and an AI teaching assistant for every teacher -- and demos some exciting new features for their educational chatbot, Khanmigo.","technology, education, AI, teaching, kids",2023,"So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, ""Tell me the answer,"" it says, ""I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?"" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, ""To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame."" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, ""Well, what do you care about?"" And let's say the student says, ""I want to be a professional athlete."" And it says, ""Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc."" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report on ""The Great Gatsby."" And when she was reading ""The Great Gatsby,"" Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, ""Why does he do that?"" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, ""Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, ""Why do you keep staring at the green light?"" ""Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life."" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying ""This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate."" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, ""It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write."" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, ""Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries."" And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, ""Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident."" And the AI says, ""Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,"" etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, ""Does my evidence support my claim?"" And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, ""On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,"" but once again, Socratically says, ""Can you tell us why?"" So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, ""The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step."" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, ""Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,"" what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you. (Applause)"

She brings this harrowing norm to light, exploring its harms and offering a more equitable process for colleges everywhere.","education, race, success, personal growth, self, mental health, writing, identity, TEDx, youth",2023,"There's a story of mine that I've told about a million different times, and it goes a little something like this. When I was 10, my family and I packed up our entire lives into large suitcases and dragged them across the Pacific to a foreign land called Canada. I was put in a school where I was the only Asian kid in my grade, and I got teased for my broken English, Asian features and funny smelling ethnic lunches. The racism was a real doozy. But don't feel bad. Through the magical healing powers of extracurricular activities and pure perseverance, I stand before you today, a new woman: healthy, healed and extremely employable. You wouldn't even be able to tell from just looking at me that I was once the weird little immigrant girl who begged her mom to pack PB&amp;J sandwiches so she wouldn't have to eat lunch alone in the bathroom. This is a story that I’ve told in academic essays, job interviews and even in the very application that got me into this fine university. It's also a story that, despite all of its truth, I've come to hate. Now this is a story that I don't have copyright claim over. It's one that continues to be regurgitated by immigrant kids all across the country to be served on a silver platter to prestigious universities who chew these stories and spit out acceptance letters in return. The contents of the story may change. Instead of a difficult immigration experience, it might be the death of a loved one, a chronic illness or a racist encounter. But what remains constant is the moral: A bad thing happened to me, but it made me a good person. This is part of a larger phenomenon that I'm here to talk about today. The overwhelming pressure being put on high school students to write about their deepest traumas in their college applications with the hopes that they seem resilient and interesting enough to be given a spot. I believe that these are not only bad metrics by which to evaluate applicants, but also incredibly harmful to the storyteller themselves and risks reinforcing existing inequities in higher education. There's also pressure that's being amplified by admissions counselors themselves who play a huge role in influencing what applicants decide to write about. Take, for example, this tip from the MIT admissions blog, where the author compares two different introductions for a potential essay. The first one reads: ""I'm honored to apply for the Master of Library Science program at the University of Okoboji. For as long as I can remember, I've had a love affair with books. Since I was 11, I've wanted to be a librarian."" The second introduction reads: ""When I was 11, my great aunt Gretchen passed away and left me something that changed my life: a library of about 5000 books. Some of my best days were spent arranging and reading her books. Since then, I've wanted to become a librarian."" The author notes that the second introduction is much more striking and leaves a much better impression. Consider another tip from collegeessayguy.com, where he advises students to “get personal.” He says, ""Weirdly, including painful memories and what you learned from them usually helps a personal statement meet the goals of a college application essay. You come off as humble, accessible, likable and mature.” Confessions from admissions officers themselves can also be telling. Aya Waller-Bey, a former admissions officer from Georgetown University, said in a ""Forbes"" article that, ""Within months on the job, I saw how the personal statements of Black and other racially minoritized students differed from those of white applicants. Black students highlighted resilience through stories of survival, while their counterparts wrote casual essays about service abroad and sporting championships. Black students shared their pain, white students shared their passions.” Now, lastly, and perhaps the least reliable source is my own life. I remember feeling this way when I was applying to universities. Like I had no other choice, no other experiences worthy of mentioning and no other merit beyond the fact that I had thrived despite what I had gone through. I even remember worrying that my tale wouldn't be harrowing enough after hearing from a counselor that writing about immigration has become a bit of a cliche because of how overused it is. So what’s the universities’ role in all of this and why are these stories even harmful to begin with? Well, I believe that using your college application essay to discuss your trauma actually doesn't help you process it. And there are a couple different reasons why. First, writing about a difficult experience is, as you may have guessed, difficult. Not only do you have to relive the event itself, but you also have to actively suppress any negative emotions that arise during the process. That kind of emotional labor can be taxing for anybody, but perhaps especially so for these young applicants who haven't had enough time on this world to process the terrible things that have happened to them. For that space to be one in which they're confessing to a faceless stranger who gets to make the most consequential decision of their adolescent life imposes an incredibly heavy psychological burden. I mean, imagine if you walked into your therapy appointment and your therapist tells you that they're not going to respond to anything you tell them except with a rejection or acceptance email sent months later. And also that whatever you tell them will determine the trajectory of your entire academic and professional career. Hard to imagine that being therapeutic. Secondly, the trauma essay makes one assumption that is extremely problematic. It's not always the learning opportunity through which you can gain more confidence or develop better time management skills. Sometimes it's just a sucky thing that really sucks. And asking students to prove how they turn their pain into progress ignores this truth and falls prey to the toxic positivity narrative that everything happens for a reason, ignoring the very valid resentment and anger that many victims still feel. Lastly, the things we write aren't just informed by our experiences, they shape how we view those experiences as well. And if we're writing about our trauma to prove to an admissions officer that we are worthy of a decent education, then it becomes necessary to sanitize our pain, to make it marketable and strategic, to scrub away all the suffering, so all that's left is what will fit into the narrow margins of what is palatable. And this is what I see as being the fundamental contradiction at the heart of the trauma essay. It seems to give the writer free reign on vulnerability, but actually leaves them very little room to be vulnerable. Your story has to be just sad enough that it gains sympathy, but not so sad that it makes you seem beyond help. Just critical enough to inspire change, but not so much that it actually criticizes systemic structures. Just honest enough to seem real, but not so unfiltered that it creates discomfort. The protagonist also overcomes whatever struggle they're facing by the end of the 500 word count, instilling the reader with a sense of optimism that despite our deeply unequal society, it is possible to rise through the ranks and overcome all the “-isms.” This, of course, is not the reality of our world today. And for me, this looked like settling for the familiar story of the stinky lunch, one that's been told so many times that it's devoid of any real meaning, instead of talking about the ongoing social and political disenfranchisement of immigrants, the permanent loss of cultural identity that I suffered, or the sense of disbelonging that still haunts me every time I make a grammar mistake or someone mispronounces my name. These are all struggles that never really go away, but are carefully tucked away in my essay because they don't fit the linear narrative that is being constructed. But how are universities to blame for all of this? I mean, they never explicitly asked students to trauma-dump in their essays, and many admissions experts have actually come out and discouraged discussing explicit trauma in essays. However, I still don't think that universities are blameless. The reason why the trauma essay is so ubiquitous is because it seems to be working. Anne Trubek, who helped low-income high school students at Oberlin College write their essays, expresses the ethical dilemma that she faces. ""By pushing students to reveal their horror stories, I risk taking away their dignity, but by not pushing, I could be hindering their chances of getting into their dream school."" Whether trauma essays and acceptance letters are actually causally correlated is impossible to tell from the outside. So this could all just be speculation and myth. But in failing to resolutely clear up these speculations and myths about whether trauma essays are rewarded or discouraged, universities are indirectly enabling the rise of the trauma essay and all of its harmful implications. So what are they to do about all of this? Well, first of all, I think that this is a problem that goes much deeper than individual universities, and even perhaps the institution of higher education itself. It's rooted in the cultural obsession with appropriating trauma and making it consumable, as well as the systemic tendency to tokenize oppressed people and their experiences. But there are still things that universities can do to make things better. First, they can be more transparent about their admissions guidelines. If it's really true that they don't want to reward trauma storytelling just for the sake of it, then they should be more forthcoming about this expectation. They could also restructure their prompts to avoid putting pressure on students to talk about past hardships and adversities and instead refocus prompts to ask students about their goals for the future and their academic interests. Secondly, admissions counselors should be trauma-informed and trained in working with BIPOC folk. As the unofficial gatekeepers to the secrets of getting into your dream college, they should wield their power responsibly and not pressure students to talk about traumatic experiences that they're not yet ready to talk about. Lastly -- and this one's for anyone who's actually applying to a postsecondary institution sometime soon -- remember that you are more than the bad things that happened to you. I know that when it seems like every other classmate of yours is writing an essay that could be adapted for an HBO original drama, that you may feel like your experiences are not worth talking about. But I promise that they are. You just have to find your voice and use it. Now as much as I don't want to live that nail-bitingly stressful time of my life ever again, I can't help but wonder: what would I have written about if I got the chance to apply to UBC again? This time absent the pressure to strategically use my immigrant background to gain sympathy points. Maybe I would have written about how I overcame my fear of public speaking and became comfortable with being the loudest voice in the room. Or I could have written about watching trashy reality television is what first sparked my interest in political science. Or maybe I still would have written about my immigrant story because that was a big part of my life journey and still impacts me to this day. But I would have done it on my own terms. Instead of being written as a one-dimensional, trauma-turned-triumph trauma drama, I would have been able to tell a story that actually reflects who I am today and acknowledge the fact that my journey is ongoing and it doesn't begin or end with my racial identity. This is the kind of ownership that I wish for everyone to one day have over their story. And now it's up for universities to decide whether they get to tell it. Thank you."
https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_kennedy_the_single_most_important_parenting_strategy?referrer=playlist-the_most_popular_ted_talks_of_2023&autoplay=true,The single most important parenting strategy,Everyone loses their temper from time to time — but the stakes are dizzyingly high when the focus of your fury is your own child. Clinical psychologist and renowned parenting whisperer Becky Kennedy is here to help. Not only does she have practical advice to help parents manage the guilt and shame of their not-so-great moments but she also models the types of conversations you can have to be a better parent. (Hint: this works in all other relationships too.) Bottom line? It's never too late to reconnect.,"psychology, relationships, communication, parenting, personal growth, mental health",2023,"Alright, quick poll -- raise your hand if you have a relationship in your life that's meaningful to you. OK, I assumed, but always good to check our assumptions. (Laughter) I’m saying this because while I'll be focusing today on a parent-child relationship, please know that everything I'm talking about is applicable to any meaningful relationship. So with that in mind, let's jump in. So it's Sunday night, I'm in my kitchen. I just finished cooking dinner for my family, and I am on edge. I mean, I'm exhausted, I haven't been sleeping well. I’m anxious about the upcoming workweek, I'm overwhelmed by all the items on my unfinished to-do list. And then, my son walks into the kitchen. He looks at the table and whines, ""Chicken again?"" (Laughter) ""Disgusting."" (Laughter) And that's it. I snap. I look at him and I yell, ""What is wrong with you? Can you be grateful for one thing in your life?"" And things get worse from there. He screams, ""I hate you."" He runs out of the room and he slams his bedroom door. And now, my self-loathing session begins, as I say to myself, ""What is wrong with me? I've messed up my kid forever."" Well, if you're a parent, you've probably felt that pain. For me, it comes with an extra layer of shame. I mean, I’m a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people become better parents. (Laughter) And yet, this is true as well -- there is no such thing as a perfect parent. Mistakes and struggles, they come with the job, but no one tells us what to do next. Do we just move on? Kind of just pretend the whole thing never happened? Or if I say something, what are the words? Well, for years, as a clinical psychologist in private practice, I saw client after client struggle with this question. And now, as the creator of the parenting content and community platform ""Good Inside,"" I see millions of parents around the globe struggle with this issue. All parents yell. No one knows what to do next. Well, I'm determined to fill this gap. After all, there's almost nothing within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as repair. Whenever a parent asks me, ""What one parenting strategy should I focus on?"" I always say the same thing: ""Get good at repair."" So what is repair? Repair is the act of going back to a moment of disconnection. Taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact it had on another. And I want to differentiate a repair from an apology, because when an apology often looks to shut a conversation down -- “Hey, I’m sorry I yelled. Can we move on now?” -- a good repair opens one up. And if you think about what it means to get good at repair, there's so much baked-in realism and hope and possibility. Repair assumes there's been a rupture. So to repair, you have to mess up or fall short of someone else's expectations. Which means the next time I snap at my kid, or my husband, or my work colleague, instead of berating myself, like I did that night in the kitchen, I try to remind myself I'm focusing on getting good at repair. Step one is rupture. ""Check that off, I crushed it."" (Laughter) Step two is repair. ""I can do this. I'm actually right on track."" So let's get back to my example. I'm in the kitchen, my son is in his room. Well, what will happen if I don't repair? That’s really important to understand and helps us make a decision about what to do next. Well, here are the facts. My son is alone, overwhelmed and in a state of distress, because, let's face it, his mom just became scary mom. And now, he has to figure out a way to get back to feeling safe and secure. And if I don't go help him do that through making a repair, he has to rely on one of the only coping mechanisms he has at his own disposal ... self-blame. Self-blame sounds like this: “Something’s wrong with me. I’m unlovable. I make bad things happen.” Ronald Fairbairn may have said it best when he wrote that, for kids, it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil. In other words, it's actually adaptive for a child to internalize badness and fault, because at least then, they can hold onto the idea that their parents and the world around them is safe and good. And while self-blame works for us in childhood, we all know it works against us in adulthood. “Something’s wrong with me. I make bad things happen. I’m unlovable.” These are the core fears of so many adults. But really, we see here, they are actually the childhood stories we wrote when we were left alone following distressing events that went unrepaired. Plus, adults with self-blame are vulnerable to depression, anxiety, deep feelings of worthlessness -- none of which we want for our kids. And we can do better. And it doesn't mean we have to be perfect. When you repair, you go further than removing a child's story of self-blame. You get to add in all the elements that were missing in the first place. Safety, connection, coherence, love, goodness. It's as if you're saying to a child, ""I will not let this chapter of your life end in self-blame. Yes, this chapter will still contain the event of yelling, but I can ensure this chapter has a different ending, and therefore a different title, and theme and lesson learned."" We know that memory is original events combined with every other time you've remembered that event. This is why therapy's helpful, right? When you remember painful experiences from your past within a safer and more connected relationship, the event remains, but your story of the event, it changes, and then you change. With repair, we effectively change the past. So let's write a better story. Let's learn how to repair. Step one, repair with yourself. That's right. I mean, you can't offer compassion or groundedness or understanding to someone else before you access those qualities within yourself. Self-repair means separating your identity, who you are, from your behavior, what you did. For me, it means telling myself two things are true. I’m not proud of my latest behavior and my latest behavior doesn't define me. Even as I struggle on the outside, I remain good inside. I can then start to see that I'm a good parent -- identity -- who was having a hard time -- behavior. And no, this doesn't let me off the hook. This is precisely what leaves me on the hook for change. Because now that I've replaced my spiral with groundedness, I can actually use my energy toward thinking about what I want to do differently the next time. Oh, and I can now use my energy to go repair with my son. Step two -- repair with your child. There's no exact formula. I often think about three elements: name what happened, take responsibility, state what you would do differently the next time. It could come together like this. ""Hey. I keep thinking about what happened the other night in the kitchen. I'm sorry I yelled. I'm sure that felt scary. And it wasn't your fault. I'm working on staying calm, even when I'm frustrated."" A 15-second intervention can have a lifelong impact. I've replaced my child's story of self-blame with a story of self-trust and safety and connection. I mean, what a massive upgrade. And to give a little more clarity around how to repair, I want to share a few examples of what I call ""not repair,"" which are things that come more naturally to most of us -- definitely me included. ""Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you in the kitchen, but if you wouldn't have complained about dinner, it wouldn't have happened."" (Laughter) Been there? Been there? OK. Or ""You know, you really need to be grateful for things in your life, like a home-cooked meal. Then, you won't get yelled at."" (Laughter) Not only do these interventions fail at the goal of reconnection, they also insinuate that your child caused your reaction, which simply isn’t true and isn't a model of emotion regulation we want to pass on to the next generation. (Applause) So let's say we've all resisted the ""it was your fault, anyway"" not-repairs, and have instead prioritized a repair that allows us to reconnect. What might the impact be? What might that look like in adulthood? My adult child won’t spiral in self-blame when they make a mistake, and won’t take on blame for someone else’s mistake. My adult child will know how to take responsibility for their behavior, because you've modeled how to take responsibility for yours. Repairing with a child today sets the stage for these critical adult relationship patterns. Plus, it gets better -- now that I've reconnected with my son, I can do something really impactful. I can teach him a skill he didn't have in the first place, which is how kids actually change their behavior. So maybe the next day, I say ""You know, you're not always going to like what I make for dinner. Instead of saying 'that's disgusting,' I wonder if you could say 'not my favorite.'"" Now I'm teaching him how to regulate his understandable disappointment, and communicate effectively and respectfully with another person. That never would have happened if instead, I had been blaming him for my reaction. So here's the point where you might have a lingering concern. Maybe you're thinking, ""You know, I have a feeling that my kid's older than your kid."" (Laughter) ""I think it's too late."" Or ""I have done a lot worse than you did in the kitchen."" (Laughter) ""Maybe it's too late."" Well, I mean this -- if you have only one takeaway from this talk, please let this be it: It is not too late. It is never too late. How do I know? Well, imagine, right after this, you get a call from one of your parents, and if neither of your parents are alive, imagine finding and opening a letter you hadn't seen till that moment. OK, walk through this with me, here's the call. ""Hey, I know this sounds out of the blue, but I've been thinking a lot about your childhood. And I think there were a lot of moments that felt really bad to you. And you are right to feel that way. Those moments weren't your fault. They were times when I was struggling, and if I could have gone back, I would have stepped aside, I would have calmed myself down, and then found you to help you with whatever you were struggling with. I'm sorry. And if you're ever willing to talk to me about any of those moments, I'll listen. I won't listen to have a rebuttal. I'll listen to understand. I love you."" I don't know many adults who don't have a fairly visceral reaction to that exercise. I often hear, “Why am I crying?” Or ""Listen, that wouldn't change everything. But it might change some things."" Well, I definitely do not specialize in math, but here's something I know with certainty. If you have a child, that child is younger than you are. (Laughter) Always true. The story of their life is shorter and even more amenable to editing. So if that imagined exercise had an impact on you, imagine the impact an actual repair will have on your child. See? I told you, it's never too late. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

How a conspiracy takes flight,"Peter McIndoe isn't a fan of birds. In fact, he has a theory about them that might shock you. Listen along to this eye-opening talk as it takes a turn and makes a larger point about conspiracies, truth and belonging in divisive times.","social change, relationships, communication, community, United States, personal growth",2023,"Hi, I'm Peter. And six years ago, I received information that changed the course of the rest of my life. From 1969 through 2001, the US government murdered over 12 billion birds in the American skies. They did this using poisonous toxins dropped from airplanes that was contagious and murdered all of the birds over the course of about 40 years. Now, I know this is not the public understanding of this and may sound absurd, but please just bear with me and keep an open mind and just be respectful, please, as I share this information with you. I know a lot of you may be wondering why would the government kill 12 billion birds? It seems like an awful lot of trouble for a government to go through. The reason is as devastating as it is simple. For each bird the government killed, they replaced it with a surveillance drone replica in disguise designed to spy on the American people. Now ... Some may say, if you're the government, at least, that this is a worthy sacrifice, these 12 billion lives, for the safety of the people, right? I don't know about that, it seems like a pretty serious limit on our freedom, wouldn't you agree? The proof that birds are robots is all around us, if you start looking. For starters, birds charge their batteries on power lines -- (Laughter) So they can refuel up high and they can watch the civilians, you know. They also track civilians using a liquid tracking device. (Laughter) You ever wonder why birds poop on your car? Do you need more evidence? Really, I can go all day up here. Who here has seen a baby pigeon? You haven't, have you? It's weird. There's all these adult pigeons where are all the babies? They come out of the factory as adults, so ... (Laughter) There's no organic growth, you know. It's a smoking gun. Over the years, as I began putting this information together, I began realizing the extent of all this. And there were times I wished I never even learned this. My life would be so much easier. You know, I remember before I knew this information, I was happier, my steps were lighter, you know. But I always come back to this. It is my moral obligation as one of the few privileged enough to know this, to share it with you, the blind sheep, you know. (Laughter) And that's what I've been doing for years now. I'm a part of a movement called Birds Aren't Real. And in 2021, I was promoted to public information officer for the movement. It's the honor of my life. I had one job. Oh, thank you, thank you. (Applause) Thank you. My one job was to deprogram the public from the bird lie. And deprogram is a very specific word because you all are programmed. You know that, right? We live in a pro-bird civilization drenched in propaganda. For instance, every state has a state bird, the national mascot is a bald eagle, presidents don't talk, they tweet, then the tweets are covered on the bird-logo media. Once I knew this, my first order of business was to get the information out to the American people, get off the internet into the real world. So that's what I did. I bought a van, covered it in decals with facts. I wanted to turn the highway into an information highway, awaken the people. I went city to city, holding rallies, meeting up with our thousands of supporters, growing by the day. And I was putting up billboards wherever we went, sharing our simple but powerful message. Look how beautiful it is. Now, the government, (Laughter) the government did take note of what we were doing and they sent some intimidators to try and deter us from our mission. You can see them right there. (Laughter) But we did not fold. We kept on going. We started holding rallies at some of the most evil pro-bird corporations in the world, starting with Twitter, where we brought hundreds out to protest their pro-bird logo. Months later, we brought 500 people out to CNN headquarters to demand fairer coverage for bird truthers on air. Then just last year, we brought 2,000 people out to Washington Square in New York City to demand that the mayor shut down every pigeon in the city. (Laughter) Here's what that looked like. (Crowd shouting) Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! (Laughter) Can't even tell you how that felt. I took that video standing on the top of the van, megaphone in hand, knowing we were awakening a country that needs it so badly. I can't think of anything more beautiful. OK, let me start this talk over. I do not actually believe that birds are robots. And everyone else in this picture is also in on the bit. This is a character that I played for four years. The leader of a fake movement with fake evidence and a fake history. Our goal was to convince the public that our satirical movement was a real one. And see if the media would believe what we were saying. To do this, I played this character that I just showed you. We held rallies, put up billboards. We even sent the media a lot of fake evidence. We hired an old actor to pose as an ex-CIA agent confessing to his crimes. We sent them a historic email leak called ""Poultry Gate"" that came out of the Pentagon, (Laughter) where we forged hundreds of fake emails exposing elites and government officials in the bird drone surveillance plot. It didn't take much to convince the media. After just one summer holding rallies like this, it became nationally syndicated news on tons of local news stations that we were a real movement that had been around for 50 years. And there was a resurgence happening where it was coming back and there was a radical new leader, myself, bringing the movement back as the rise of conspiracy theories swept the nation. At this point, I'm sitting on my couch, watching the media report on my fake movement as a real one and figure it is probably time to come out of character. One, because we'd accomplished what we came there to do. But also, I didn't want this to snowball in anything that was never supposed to. So in 2021, I broke character, revealed the movement was a farce on the front page of The New York Times. And I was very proud, as you can see. Allow me to reintroduce myself one more time. Hi, I'm Peter. Can you say, ""Hi, Peter?"" (Audience) Hi, Peter. Hey. I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in Arkansas in Little Rock, where I was home-schooled on the outskirts of town. The community that I grew up with was hyper conservative and religious, and almost everyone that I knew believed in some form of conspiracy theory, whether it was that Obama was the Antichrist or that there are microchips in the vaccines. During my entire life, I always felt like I was on the fringes of normal society. So, as you can imagine, when it became time for me to play a character, the conspiracy theorist was a pretty easy one for me to tap into. During the years in character, I used the same cadence, logic and arguments as those I grew up around, just with a different theory swapped in. I was really dedicated to playing this character as convincingly as I could, as method as possible. So I spent days, sometimes, in character, a lot of time out in public with the van there, just talking with strangers. It led to hundreds of interactions with strangers who thought that I was a real conspiracy theorist. I'd often be out there, cowboy hat on, handing out fliers that said things like, ""If it flies, it's spies."" (Laughter) We had another flyer that said, ""Birdwatching goes both ways."" (Laughter) And during these times, as I'm handing out flyers and talking with people, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of instances over the years where strangers would approach me. You know, they'd see me in public and I'd see them notice me. And walk up to me with complete disdain on their face. They thought that I was a real conspiracy theorist. And time and time again, they'd come up to me, look me right in the eyes, just as close as I am to you right here, and they would tell me how stupid I am. They'd tell me I was uneducated, that I was crazy. That I was the problem with this country. When this happens, I didn't feel the emotions of the character that I thought I would. My out-of-character self may interpret these interactions as a funny response to someone that fell for the comedy project, but instead I felt the emotions of the character. I felt emboldened and I felt sad and angry. Like they didn't even take the time to know me. They instantly condemned me, judged me and othered me. I'd found myself on the opposite side of this equation that I'd grown up around, the normal and the fringe. And in those moments when those people were talking to me, they could not have been more ineffective at what I would assume they really want. Less conspiracy theorists in the world. These experiences, hundreds of them over the years, watching how people interact with those on the fringes of our society gave me an entirely new perspective on our approach to conspiracy theorists, whether it's how we frame them in the conventional media, to how we deal with those in our own lives. If our goal is to live in a shared reality with our neighbors, what if our current approach isn't bringing us any closer to that? What if by talking to conspiracy theorists like they're ignorant and stupid, we're actually pushing them farther away from the truth that we want them to see? Because what happens when someone tells you that you're stupid, you're all wrong, you're the problem? You'll feel judged and dismissed. And most importantly, you’ll feel othered, which may lead you to look for safety in those who are like-minded to do what they have been doing for you. Affirm your selfhood, give you a sense of identity, belonging. These are some of the most basic human desires. We have to consider that conspiracy theorists are not just joining these groups for no reason. They're getting rewards out of these, things that we are all looking for, a sense of purpose, community. I grew up with the internet and during my time with this project, especially out of character, people have talked to me about the misinformation age and this, you know, terrifying problem of online echo chambers and conspiracy theorists. But I want to remind us that there are humans behind a lot of these screens. It's not just numbers. Everyone’s unique experience influences their own narrative about the world, and there's no blueprint for how to deal with this yet. But I do not think that online echo chambers of conspiracy theorists are this inevitable symptom of life online. The internet is about 30 years old and things are changing quickly, and I think it'll be very important that we develop new solutions for these new problems on a fundamental level. What if by addressing belief before belonging, we're starting the conversation at the wrong place? Instead of sitting in collective bewilderment and frustration about how these people could believe these things, these crazies, what if we first looked under the hood and thought about what made them vulnerable to this information in the first place? What might they be getting out of this that they're not getting in their everyday lives? How much does it have to do with a different truth, or how much does it have to do with the community that that truth brings? We need to think about people's circumstances and reference points, to see them as fellow human beings who want to believe in something and want to belong, just like all of us do in this room. Because if we continue with our current approach of arguing on the level of belief, it's not going to get us anywhere. We're going to end up with more echo chambers, more disinformation and more polarization. Instead, we can do the harder work of looking into what is fueling the need for an alternate truth. Not only would this lend us more empathy for those who think differently than us, but I really think this might be the only actually productive means, productive means, of moving toward the shared reality that we all want to live in. Let's direct our energy toward the crisis of belonging. And then maybe we will understand the crisis of belief. Before I go, I'll leave with one more word. Just don’t forget: if it flies, it's spies. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

But she didn't always know if she'd make it big. In a lively talk sparkling with actionable advice, she shares how her struggles taught her what it takes to believe in herself -- and how we can all find the self-confidence to keep moving forward.","entertainment, success, motivation, personal growth, goals",2023,"(Singing) I am an endangered species (Applause and cheers) But I sing no victim song. I am a woman. I am an artist. And I know where my voice ... belongs. (Applause and cheers) Now, you might have heard me sing that song. It was September 12th, 2022, right after Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers said, ""And the winner is, Sheryl Lee Ralph!"" What!? I had just won the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a comedy for my role as Mrs. Barbara Howard on your favorite TV show, ""Abbott Elementary."" (Cheers) Oh, yes. And I was shocked. As the children would say, shooketh into disbelief. Oh, my goodness, it was my first time at the Emmys and I won. Yes! And I got to tell you, in that moment, I was so stunned into disbelief that I don't know how I got up on the stage. There I was, just listening to that roar of applause. Mm mm mm. And my whole career flashed right there in front of me. Starting with 19-year-old Sheryl Lee in her first movie being directed by the great Sidney Poitier. Oh, yeah, you can clap that. (Applause) Followed by ten years of “no” after “no” after “no.” Before the next film role came about. But I filled in that time with TV and more ""nos"" and more rejection until I made it big on Broadway in what has become the iconic musical of the '80s, because I say so, (Laughter) ""Dreamgirls."" (Applause) And boy, did I learn a lot of life lessons there. And I mean, after so many moments of doubt, disbelief, there I was, on that Emmy stage, with this huge sign in front of me flashing ""Stop now,"" ""Stop now,"" ""Stop now."" And I started to think, “My God, what if I had stopped after all of those ‘nos?’ What if I had stopped after all of those moments of feeling defeated? What if I had stopped?"" I wouldn't be standing there for that golden moment. But right now, many of us, we are feeling ... deeply challenged trying to hold on and believe in ourselves, and I do not mean in a toxic way. I am talking about a way that comes from confidence, the kind of confidence that can keep us moving forward when we are feeling like we are carrying the weight of the pandemic, trying to figure out all of this political division, fighting all of the mental, physical, social violence in our homes, in our communities, to climate change, social media. It's a lot. Making it hard to believe in the goodness in the world. And harder still to believe in the goodness of ourselves. This is a rough time, people, and our mental health is suffering. We all need a checkup from the neck up. (Laughter) And I don't mean -- yeah, it's OK. You feel me, thank you. (Applause) And I don't mean just medicine. I actually mean reframing our thinking of our ability to believe in ourselves. Now I know, you see me on TV, in magazines, on movie screens, and you might be thinking to yourself, ""What does she know about struggling to believe in herself?"" Well, let me tell you something. I do not look like my journey. (Laughter) (Applause) Oh, I've been through a few things. And the struggle is real. But I have learned something in my life. That there are three things that we all must do in order to believe in ourselves. Number one. First, we need to see ourselves. I mean, really, truly, deeply see ourselves for who and what we are in order to believe in ourselves. I’m a child of the ’60s, and that was hard. Oh. In the third grade, I tested out of public school into a fancy private school where the only Black person I saw every day was the one who looked back at me in the mirror. I was by myself, and I was all alone. And the things that were said to me, and I'm not talking about just the kids, but the adults, too. And when I would come home from school crying the ugly cry, my immigrant Jamaican mother would sit me down in front of the mirror and ask me, ""Do you see an N-word? Do you see a liar? Do you see a big-lip monkey? No! So dry your eyes. And when you go back to school, remember, you are rubber, they are glue. And every ignorant thing they say about you bounces off of you and sticks to them."" (Applause) And I believed her. And it didn't hurt. So much. Because I believed. Number two. We've got to think. Think about ourselves in order to believe in ourselves. Growing up, my dad had a sign on his desk. And it said, ""Think."" ""Think."" Oh, I did not know how valuable and powerful the simple act of thinking was until I came back to Hollywood from my triumphant run on Broadway, and I had this meeting with a big studio Hollywood casting director. Oh, I was so excited. I walked in and he looked at me and he said, ""Hm. Everybody knows you're a beautiful, talented Black girl. But what do I do with a beautiful, talented Black girl? Do I put you in a movie with Tom Cruise? Does he kiss you? Ugh. Who goes to see that movie?"" (Laughs) I could not believe that that man had just said that to me, to my face. And he hurt me. He hurt me so deeply, I was actually thinking about quitting. Until ... I started to think. And I thought about what he said. He said that everybody knew that I was a beautiful, talented Black girl. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) And that I deserve to be cast in movies with the likes of Tom Cruise, and he should kiss me. (Applause) (Laughs) So what was meant to break me did not break me, it built me up. I believed that man, I believed what he said. And I walked out of there giving myself permission to take up space in Hollywood, knowing that I belonged there no matter what anybody thought about me. (Cheers and applause) Thirdly. We've got to act like we believe in ourselves. Oh, yeah. Because when we believe in ourselves and act on it, we create possibilities that never would have been possible had we not just believed. OK, so I will tell you another story. I will never forget walking into one of those crowded Hollywood rooms, and I see Harry Thomason, producer Harry Thomason, who is married to Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, writer, creator of the series ""Designing Women."" I walk right up to Harry and I say, ""How can it be, that after all of these years Anthony has not had a relationship with a Black woman? After all, the show takes place in Atlanta, Georgia."" (Laughter) He looked at me, took a step back and said, ""Who are you?"" I said, ""I'm Sheryl Lee Ralph."" And he said, ""OK. Have your people call my people and we will see what we can do."" And guess what happened? (Laughter) I got cast as Etienne Toussaint Bouvier, Las Vegas showgirl turned Anthony's wife for the final season of ""Designing Women."" (Cheers and applause) Oh, yeah. Against all odds, once again, I gave myself permission to take up space, believing that I belonged. I believed that if Sheryl Lee did the work of honing her craft, building solid relationships and stayed ready so she didn't have to get ready, anything was possible. Heck, winning an Emmy. A Grammy. An Oscar. A Tony. EGOT it, baby. (Cheering) So ... When you leave this room today, I challenge all of you to start a meaningful practice of looking in the mirror and loving what you see. Believe in what you see. If you can't love it, then respect it. And if you can't respect it, then encourage it. If you can't encourage it, empower it. And if you can't empower it, please be kind to it. (Applause) The greatest relationship, the greatest one you will ever have is with yourself. Believe me. Have faith in yourself. Believing that faith can make broken wings fly. And we deserve to soar. Remember, maybe one of these days when you pass the mirror and you catch a glimpse of yourself, remember, I told you this. That is what believing looks like. And don't you ever, ever, ever give up on you. I am Sheryl Lee Ralph, and I love you just the way you are. (Singing) Believe in yourself As I believe in you Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"
